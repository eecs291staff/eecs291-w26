00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.490
Marcus M Darden: Keep your…

2
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.209
Marcus M Darden: Guidelines, folks.

3
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.549
Marcus M Darden: It's an item.

4
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.909
Marcus M Darden: A lot of parents.

5
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.000
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

6
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.150
Marcus M Darden: Oh man, it's been so long.

7
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.780
Marcus M Darden: That's fine.

8
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.740
Marcus M Darden: It's coming back to me, though. Oh, yeah, look at that! Now you can see the screen, it's everything.

9
00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:02.219
Marcus M Darden: Okay, that's still a little dark, we'll have to deal with lights later. Might have some better lighting in the future, but these are going to be hard to see if there's lights over the top of them.

10
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.010
Marcus M Darden: It's capability.

11
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.560
Marcus M Darden: Tune Predictor…

12
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.490
Marcus M Darden: Don't kill you, Doc.

13
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.669
Marcus M Darden: Oh, look at that, there we go, some decent light.

14
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.630
Marcus M Darden: Alright, well…

15
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.649
Marcus M Darden: Doing weird things. Let's get started. I am Professor Darden. This is 291.

16
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:21.719
Marcus M Darden: This is the first time we've had this, and so it's a whole bunch of new stuff. This is gonna be, like, a wild semester for me, just so you know.

17
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:40.239
Marcus M Darden: Hopefully we won't break too many things, though it won't be for lack of trying. One of the things that we don't know, really, is just where people are in terms of their knowledge. So, how many of you have done stuff in Python in the past?

18
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.750
Marcus M Darden: A little bit, a lot, a course worth… Ish?

19
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.600
Marcus M Darden: Some, none? What about you?

20
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.250
Marcus M Darden: Anything?

21
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.649
Marcus M Darden: Python, have you done?

22
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.999
Marcus M Darden: Some? Yes, some. Okay.

23
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.899
Marcus M Darden: All right, well, yeah, that's where we don't know where to dial things in at, in terms of difficulty, so,

24
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:13.000
Marcus M Darden: We'll see if we have any issues along the way, just… just talk to me, right? We gotta know what we're shooting for.

25
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:25.629
Marcus M Darden: So, Rafe is on the end there, he's our actual staff member. The rest of those guys, they just hang out all the time, so… that's why, I don't know, I like… I like having them around, they're like…

26
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:37.299
Marcus M Darden: my hype squad, but they're always doing their own thing. But, yeah, so those three are just here for the fact that we're all here, so I don't know, they're used to hanging out with us in the afternoons, and here we are in class now.

27
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.139
Marcus M Darden: So Rafe will be working with you in… Office hours and in lab.

28
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:53.119
Marcus M Darden: And then the way that… We are going to be doing stuff through the course.

29
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.590
Marcus M Darden: many of these things, Rafe and I are still, like.

30
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.609
Marcus M Darden: hashing out on a daily basis, like, hey, check these slides out this morning, does this look like it's gonna make sense? And it's good. So,

31
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.370
Marcus M Darden: So here's where we're gonna start.

32
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.359
Marcus M Darden: Oh, sweet, just in time.

33
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:31.739
Marcus M Darden: We haven't gotten anything difficult yet. So I think at the cap, we're gonna have, like, 11 people, so I'm happy that you all are sitting in these front 4 or 5 rows, at least in the central section. It's always more work if I have to look farther to find what people are up for, so…

34
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.640
Marcus M Darden: If you can come in and sit in the first 4 or 5 rows here in the center every time, that would be greatly appreciated.

35
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:47.720
Marcus M Darden: Just in time to catch that message as well. So, 2, 4, 6, 8, and I think there's 11.

36
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.250
Marcus M Darden: or 13 and 3… how many are in… means a lot.

37
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.209
Marcus M Darden: So, there's a… is there 11 in 402?

38
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:09.710
Marcus M Darden: And how many in 291? 10 and 1. 10 and 1? Oh, okay. So it's 10 and 1. So, we're looking for 11 people total. Air play code. Put it in.

39
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.180
Marcus M Darden: This is 16… 70, right?

40
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.900
Marcus M Darden: 0833. Go.

41
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:49.370
Marcus M Darden: Hey! Alright. Okay, so, everything is gonna be run through Git.

42
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:58.409
Marcus M Darden: So, if you don't have Git skills, we need to get you there. Also, using GitHub.

43
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.580
Marcus M Darden: So, I was just in my office.

44
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:08.819
Marcus M Darden: And had a panic attack about 30 minutes ago, and I was like, I have no way to get them notebooks.

45
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:25.159
Marcus M Darden: So, I wrote this in short order. So here's the repo, and I'm gonna pull it up on screen and do it with you. So, if you've got a machine, break it out. If you don't have a command line version of this right now,

46
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.190
Marcus M Darden: That's gonna make things a little bit more difficult, but you can still do this on your own time here.

47
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:39.950
Marcus M Darden: How can they see… Notebooks on their… iPads.

48
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.850
Marcus M Darden: Okay.

49
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.650
Marcus M Darden: Well, there's a… there's a… there's an alternative to that. So I can take the notebooks and generate

50
00:07:52.580 --> 00:08:00.370
Marcus M Darden: static slides. But the way that it's gonna work is, has anybody here used Jupyter Notebook with Python?

51
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.000
Marcus M Darden: Yes, everyone that's Pythoned?

52
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:15.489
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so for those of you who haven't and are just nodding to look like you're with the rest of the people, Jupyter Notebook is sort of a Python extension that allows you to have

53
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.119
Marcus M Darden: sort of text and Python in the same environment.

54
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:36.000
Marcus M Darden: And so, part of it is done in markdowns, you can get some nice presentable text, and then part of it is done in different cells where you can actually execute Python. So, that's what the notes are gonna be for this course, is gonna be Jupyter notebooks.

55
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.049
Marcus M Darden: But then additionally to that, you can add another extension to Jupyter Notebooks and make the Jupyter Notebook look like

56
00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:44.640
Marcus M Darden: slides.

57
00:08:44.660 --> 00:09:00.140
Marcus M Darden: So I'll be using that as slides, and what I'll be going through up here on the fronts, once we get you all in the same place, what I'll be going through on the fronts will be slides, but you'll have the actual notebooks so that you can truck through the notebook yourself.

58
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.959
Marcus M Darden: And add notes as you like.

59
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:22.389
Marcus M Darden: run stuff in the execution environment to make sure that things make sense, and everything will also happen to be… you do some commits and pushes so we can check to see what's going on, and that's just the general there. So, I've got a window open over here into my home directory, you can see it there, and then what I'm gonna do is…

60
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.879
Marcus M Darden: Get a copy of…

61
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:33.530
Marcus M Darden: this, which is our student materials repo, and so, if you go to this, I think you can see the address

62
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.060
Marcus M Darden: up there, no, you cannot. So…

63
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.799
Marcus M Darden: Let's go here and say that…

64
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.000
Marcus M Darden: That's the repo address.

65
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.589
Marcus M Darden: Right, so if you want to,

66
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:06.330
Marcus M Darden: Use that for later, or if you're putting that in notes, or it's gonna be useful to… you can even dial this up on your screen right now.

67
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:15.480
Marcus M Darden: That'll get you to this thing. It's a public repo, and the way that I will use it is I will put stuff in there for you, and then I will tell you that it's there.

68
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:30.490
Marcus M Darden: through, like, either an ed post, or we'll just have a regular schedule, so what happens, it'll be some combination of those things. When new lecture notes come out, I'll say they're there. You just go into your repo, you'll do a pull, and then you'll have the stuff.

69
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.660
Marcus M Darden: Right, if you make any edits.

70
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:52.030
Marcus M Darden: to your own notebooks locally, that's totally fine, because I won't be changing anything that I'm pushing out to you. So, as you make… as you make, as you make your own edits, as you add notes to the notes, it'd be perfectly fine. If I ever have to make any changes.

71
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:56.279
Marcus M Darden: then I'll have to send you something separate, so it'll be like.

72
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:10.769
Marcus M Darden: Lecture 4 update. So then you would pull that down, because if you get to writing on things, then I get to writing on things, then we have merge conflicts, and nobody wants to deal with that at that point. This is not that course.

73
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:28.799
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, I'm over here, and I'm just gonna walk through this thing step by step. I'll put it up on the screen so you can see it. You can pull yours up on the screen if you want to, but here, down at the bottom, we've got this thing that says Quick Start in Jupyter. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna make…

74
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.149
Marcus M Darden: some directory to put stuff into, and so I'm gonna use the maker command.

75
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.630
Marcus M Darden: And I make this directory called courses.

76
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:43.150
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna CD into that directory, maker equs 291…

77
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.310
Marcus M Darden: And I'm gonna change the directory into that directory.

78
00:11:46.920 --> 00:12:01.529
Marcus M Darden: And then this, in my opinion, is where I'm gonna keep all the stuff from this course. I'll put the lecture stuff, or the course stuff from me, you'll have your own individual project directories in there, I'm not having you keep your project directories there, this is mostly just gonna be for…

79
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.730
Marcus M Darden: Back and forths and notes.

80
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:19.809
Marcus M Darden: So, from here, once I'm in this directory, or wherever you're feeling comfortable with storing all of your work for the semester at the top level, then we're gonna jump to this, this quick start here, and it says it wants me to clone something from that same address.

81
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.340
Marcus M Darden: So, there, it's cloned in. I can then change into that directory.

82
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:53.129
Marcus M Darden: As it says in this thing. And we'll talk about virtual environments in a little bit, but for right now, you've got to have one, and so we're gonna pull this off by running this next command, which says, use Python 3 to run this library named Venv.

83
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.170
Marcus M Darden: as a module.

84
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:03.390
Marcus M Darden: So, run that module, that's what the dash m is, and then what I want to do is I want to create a virtual environment in this

85
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:13.030
Marcus M Darden: hidden directory named .VENV. So, here I am in this directory, I just created a new environment, and you see if I type ls.

86
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.729
Marcus M Darden: I've got all of the stuff that I just cloned.

87
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:38.000
Marcus M Darden: But I also have that VEN directory, but because it's got a dot in front of it, Linux and Unix try to hide those things from you, so they're called hidden files. If I do an LS minus A, you'll see there's the Venv directory, this is where my environment is, and I can install things in there. There's the Git directory where all of the Git…

88
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.920
Marcus M Darden: Hard.

89
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:44.040
Marcus M Darden: links and all that stuff are. So, I've done that.

90
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:54.220
Marcus M Darden: And then what I want to do is activate that one, and you see, when I type source… BMV…

91
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.600
Marcus M Darden: Right? Doesn't do a whole lot, but look here.

92
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.470
Marcus M Darden: Now, before…

93
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:15.540
Marcus M Darden: my prompt just had whatever my system prompt was, and then my path, and then percent, but now I've got this…

94
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:29.270
Marcus M Darden: tag here that tells me that I'm in the virtual environment, and the name of it is .veenv. So, if you choose to name it anything else, you can. That's just a convention. You could name it

95
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:39.880
Marcus M Darden: 291, you could name it Thursdays, you can put whatever word you want in there, and then it will be in that directory here, and show up inside that thing there.

96
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.309
Marcus M Darden: Like I said, if you use a dot in front of it, then it typically hides, and you don't have to worry about seeing it.

97
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:56.449
Marcus M Darden: So once I've got that activated, now anything that I do to my Python or with my Python is using that particular Python.

98
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:03.660
Marcus M Darden: And this is important because system tools use Python on macOS.

99
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:10.789
Marcus M Darden: And so it's expecting a particular Python to be there. As different versions of Python get released.

100
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:30.940
Marcus M Darden: things get changed, and you wouldn't want your system to stop functioning, so you wouldn't want to make an update on your system Python that would prevent your system from working. Some plugins might no longer work once you get your Python to a certain area, so we use virtual environments to help us control exactly the Python and the extensions that we want.

101
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.879
Marcus M Darden: So right now, I just created this one, and then what I want to do is I want to

102
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.719
Marcus M Darden: Use the installer, which the easiest one to use in Python is called pip.

103
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.210
Marcus M Darden: PIP for…

104
00:15:46.550 --> 00:16:00.640
Marcus M Darden: Python package installer… I forget, but it's what it does. You install packages. Python installer of packages? Why is it piv? Okay. So then, after I've done the activate command here.

105
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:13.580
Marcus M Darden: now I'm at this one right here. So I'm gonna say Python run the pip module with the command install and upgrade pip, so I make sure that I've got the most up-to-date version of pip.

106
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.649
Marcus M Darden: before I start using pip to install other packages.

107
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:37.530
Marcus M Darden: There we go. So, it went and did that, so now I've got the most up-to-date version of PIP 25.3 inside of this virtual environment. I could go into another virtual environment, and I wouldn't have pip 25.3. I'd have something else.

108
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:47.070
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so once pip's up to date, then I can use pip to install Jupyter. Pip install Jupyter…

109
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:58.990
Marcus M Darden: And obviously, it's got the Python little hook in there, J-U-P-Y-T-R, but it's still pronounced Jupiter, not Jupiter.

110
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:16.130
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so a bunch of stuff flies through the screen, you see it just installed a whole bunch of stuff, but all of that stuff is installed into this virtual environment, not into my system. So if I deactivate this environment, which… which is a thing you can do, right? If I just type deactivate.

111
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.950
Marcus M Darden: you see that I no longer have

112
00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:26.470
Marcus M Darden: this .vn in front of it. So now I'm back in my top-level environment, and…

113
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:30.290
Marcus M Darden: that Jupyter that I just installed is not available.

114
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.550
Marcus M Darden: Right? So… if I type Jupiter… notebook.

115
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:52.420
Marcus M Darden: It's gonna be like, I don't know what Jupyter is. So you might come into this later, if you come away from your work and you come and try to get back to it, and you forget to activate. So you go into that directory, and then you have to run that command, which looks like source.

116
00:17:53.460 --> 00:18:00.630
Marcus M Darden: dot Venv bin activate, because that's the path to it, and once I do that, you see I get my…

117
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.249
Marcus M Darden: environment tag back on there. So now, if I say Jupyter Notebook.

118
00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.070
Marcus M Darden: It says, hey, I know how to do that.

119
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.770
Marcus M Darden: And…

120
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:27.409
Marcus M Darden: it kicks it off. So this is a program that's running in my terminal, so now my terminal, I can't really use it, because it's using it as… for output of this problem, so… and that's okay, because we're done working in the terminal anyway. But here, you'll see is…

121
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.529
Marcus M Darden: It popped open a window for me.

122
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.869
Marcus M Darden: And you can see that I'm a bit of a tabaholic, but…

123
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.489
Marcus M Darden: I'm in counseling, hopefully one day I'll be okay.

124
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:48.200
Marcus M Darden: So, there we are, and this is the stuff that we just downloaded, and this is… this repo.

125
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:57.029
Marcus M Darden: but delivered through Jupyter Notebook. There's nothing in any of those files, except lecture, We go into lecture.

126
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.220
Marcus M Darden: There's Lecture 0.

127
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.239
Marcus M Darden: And once I kick that off, that's what it looks like.

128
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.920
Marcus M Darden: So this is the view that you would have.

129
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:14.510
Marcus M Darden: Now, if you want to install Rise, you can, so you can look at this in Slides version, but…

130
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:30.959
Marcus M Darden: you don't have to. You can just go in here, and each one of these cells, if I use my arrow keys up and down, it can move me through this, and it's gonna be the notes, and you'll see these are all just markdown cells, because they look like nice web page stuff. Then we get into stuff like that, that's an actual

131
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.059
Marcus M Darden: Python cell, and I can run the stuff in there, and that's… that's what we'll be doing. But,

132
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.490
Marcus M Darden: That's where we are.

133
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.309
Marcus M Darden: I think my next thing that I have to do is…

134
00:19:46.430 --> 00:20:05.869
Marcus M Darden: I actually need to leave Jupyter Notebook as you guys are running it, because I need to run a different one. So when you want to get out of this, you can go into your Jupyter Notebook, and you can go back to the file view, like, see, there's the other window. When I opened up the notebook, it opens up in another tab. I can close this tab.

135
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.400
Marcus M Darden: And any changes that I make can be saved in there or not.

136
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:20.170
Marcus M Darden: But… it still hasn't left Jupyter. So Jupiter is still running in another tab, so if I want to get out of that, I can come here and,

137
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.729
Marcus M Darden: I can get out of this if I want to, if I go into File…

138
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:36.729
Marcus M Darden: shut down the server, right? So that'll shut down the local server that's running the Jupyter Notebook. It doesn't do anything to the tab, so the tab still sits there and looks like I can use it, but I can't, so,

139
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.349
Marcus M Darden: I won't. But if I look into,

140
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.310
Marcus M Darden: this, then, you'll see that I get my prompt back. It's shut down.

141
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:51.799
Marcus M Darden: Alright, the reason why I can't do it is I need some other extensions in there, and if I go here…

142
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.589
Marcus M Darden: That's really what I want. So I'm gonna say Jupyter Notebook.

143
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.790
Marcus M Darden: And… What's different?

144
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:09.339
Marcus M Darden: just my environment. I'm in the same directory. I'm in a different terminal, but it's the same directory, it's EX291 Winter 26, but you see I'm in this…

145
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.409
Marcus M Darden: Practical data science.

146
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.549
Marcus M Darden: from the 398 course. I'm in their, environment because it was nicely set up, and I liked it. So now when I run Jupyter Notebook.

147
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:31.040
Marcus M Darden: does about the same thing. Starts up Jupyter Notebook. But I can get into this… Notebook here, and…

148
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.990
Marcus M Darden: Remember how I do this.

149
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.819
Marcus M Darden: Gotta do a few little… windows that I have to.

150
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.099
Marcus M Darden: Alright. Right? So this is what you see in your notebook.

151
00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.690
Marcus M Darden: But…

152
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:10.619
Marcus M Darden: it looks nicer, looks slides-like. So, if you guys are gonna be using tablets, then I can probably just export this to…

153
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.840
Marcus M Darden: I can export these things.

154
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.790
Marcus M Darden: I can do that right now.

155
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.850
Marcus M Darden: I know that's a doable thing. If you see it, shout it out.

156
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.460
Marcus M Darden: You download as, I think? Download as, oh, nice, thank you.

157
00:22:53.730 --> 00:23:03.180
Marcus M Darden: Download as… slides… Yeah?

158
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.720
Marcus M Darden: What do you think? Maybe PDF. PDF, also a good thing.

159
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.089
Marcus M Darden: A number of HGMOs of this community.

160
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.310
Marcus M Darden: Oh, bail! Okay, well…

161
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.469
Marcus M Darden: I have to install PyQt Web Engine, so I guess we will not be going through

162
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:37.740
Marcus M Darden: like I said, we're going to be breaking some things in this class. Starts on day one.

163
00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.929
Marcus M Darden: Hey, there we go. Lecture introduction HTML.

164
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.709
Marcus M Darden: We would want to stick that in.

165
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.450
Marcus M Darden: Let's go here, let's go there…

166
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.180
Marcus M Darden: Let's put it in here. Let's put it in there.

167
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:03.829
Marcus M Darden: And save it. Another bride.

168
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.559
Marcus M Darden: Hop over to our trusty Git.

169
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.409
Marcus M Darden: And HTML version. Sure.

170
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:47.930
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so… now it looks like if you go into… this directory in the GitHub, lecture…

171
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.130
Marcus M Darden: Well, that's not helpful, is it?

172
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.929
Marcus M Darden: I want to see the actual HTML.

173
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.759
Marcus M Darden: I want to open the HTML.

174
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.060
Marcus M Darden: And I just opened it in…

175
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.290
Marcus M Darden: She fails left and right.

176
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.490
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

177
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.789
Marcus M Darden: You might be able to pick up, like, a browser.

178
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.290
Marcus M Darden: I don't think you'll be able to, like, export it to, like, a notes.

179
00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.180
Marcus M Darden: Might be able to. Seems like a reasonable thing to do, wouldn't it?

180
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.180
Marcus M Darden: How do I get it here?

181
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.420
Marcus M Darden: What do you think? If you go to your Finder, where the file is, you can probably open with Chrome.

182
00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.089
Marcus M Darden: Give it a try.

183
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.160
Marcus M Darden: Then the question is, where did I put it?

184
00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.220
Marcus M Darden: what did I call it?

185
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.950
Marcus M Darden: Oops.

186
00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.440
Marcus M Darden: There it is.

187
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.699
Marcus M Darden: It's another editor. Hey, you really want to edit this file, don't you?

188
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.709
Marcus M Darden: Okay, it's gonna have to be slides.

189
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.439
Marcus M Darden: Sorry, I don't know.

190
00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.329
Marcus M Darden: It's always something.

191
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.569
Marcus M Darden: Okay, well…

192
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.570
Marcus M Darden: Yeah, I don't know.

193
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:15.260
Marcus M Darden: Yeah, sorry about that one. I will have to track that down. I guess that's all I got. So, let's get back at it. I gotta get this going.

194
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.650
Marcus M Darden: So I'm over here, and…

195
00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.859
Marcus M Darden: Did I start that notebook up? No, I did. It's already started. There we go.

196
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.710
Marcus M Darden: slides.

197
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:47.459
Marcus M Darden: A lot of work to get to slide 1. Sorry about that, but we're here now.

198
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:52.789
Marcus M Darden: How did everybody else do it? Everybody else that's got command line, did that go okay?

199
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.170
Marcus M Darden: It's good.

200
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:03.119
Marcus M Darden: Slight nods work. Alright, we gotta get them up and going. Oh, I thought that was an iPad, so that's actually a keyboard.

201
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.149
Marcus M Darden: Oh, you switched on me. Good. I see, I see. All right.

202
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.600
Marcus M Darden: Alright, we'll get you right here. I'll have to…

203
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:17.559
Marcus M Darden: Can you see if you can figure out how to… I put it in those videos. Oh, you did? Oh, nice.

204
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.580
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so you should be able to go back to that location.

205
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.569
Marcus M Darden: And… There it is!

206
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:39.290
Marcus M Darden: Of course. Okay, so yeah, download that, and then you should be able to open up the PDF in Notability, or whatever you're annotating with. You can at least

207
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.959
Marcus M Darden: Go to work on it.

208
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.350
Marcus M Darden: Nice. Thanks, Ray. Good save.

209
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.470
Marcus M Darden: So much more colorful over here, though.

210
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:59.760
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, yes, we are into 91. We are 29 minutes into our first

211
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.870
Marcus M Darden: half of… half one course structure and policies.

212
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.470
Marcus M Darden: It always ends up this way, we're gonna be gone.

213
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.940
Marcus M Darden: Close that up. Alright.

214
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:18.940
Marcus M Darden: 80 minutes split in half, like I said, we've already used 29 of the first 40, just getting to slide 2.

215
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:27.959
Marcus M Darden: But we'll be okay. Maybe the break won't be quite at the midpoint, and then, the work that you do, we're just gonna try to get you to commit something.

216
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.160
Marcus M Darden: On your own local.

217
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.550
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

218
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:49.539
Marcus M Darden: We'll send some more information later over the ed about how to get some connection with us. We'll get that figured out. It's good. So, we're going to talk about the course structure and policies, just so we know how things work, and what a good day ends up looking like.

219
00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:13.720
Marcus M Darden: The course focus is applied first, so this is why it's not a CS major course. The major course, EX281, is similar. We… as… before we had a course number for this course, we called this course, you know, its nickname was PI81, so it's the 281 course.

220
00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:29.690
Marcus M Darden: in Python, which is close to correct, because it's generally the same material, but like I said, because it's less theoretical and a bit more applied, it's just more approachable, and it's less something that majors need, and so the majors can't take it for credit.

221
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:37.649
Marcus M Darden: So, we'll be doing this, and I teach 281 and have taught 281 every semester I've been here since…

222
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.800
Marcus M Darden: Back in… the teens…

223
00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:48.900
Marcus M Darden: So, I do this stuff back and forth. I do the theoretical version in the mornings. From 10.30 to 12, I talk…

224
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:55.049
Marcus M Darden: data structures and algorithms in C++, and then 3 to 4.30, I'll be teaching it here in Python.

225
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.109
Marcus M Darden: Here's who we're looking at, people who have already had some CS2.

226
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:15.729
Marcus M Darden: So, one of the CS2s that you can take, the undergrad version, is EX280. The grad student version is EX 402, so if you haven't had any other stuff, you might want to take one of those before this course.

227
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:30.030
Marcus M Darden: But it's intended for CS minors, DS grad students, and others who want to get some more programming, but can't necessarily maybe want to take the full 281, or can't take the 281. So, CS majors can take the course, but it won't count towards their major.

228
00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:48.160
Marcus M Darden: We're gonna break the course into these four quarters. I was trying to keep things really regular, with a pace that you can get attached to, and then know how things are gonna go. And so, the semester divided up pretty nicely into what looked like quarters.

229
00:32:48.380 --> 00:33:00.800
Marcus M Darden: So, in terms of a year, it's more like an eighth, obviously. Some schools have quarters where a quarter means the entire calendar year, but these are quarters within the semester, and each quarter has got two labs.

230
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.090
Marcus M Darden: One project, and an exam.

231
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:12.999
Marcus M Darden: So you can think of those as being, I think it's 6 lectures per quarter.

232
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:19.489
Marcus M Darden: So we'll have 4 lectures, and those are gonna be the more applied lectures.

233
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:32.189
Marcus M Darden: The stuff that is going to help you with the project during those two weeks of the four lectures, we'll also have the two labs, and then in the third week of the quarter, there'll be no lab.

234
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:46.919
Marcus M Darden: And there'll be more theoretical material, a little bit light, but that's the stuff that's not going to be touched very heavily on the exam. So, the applied stuff will be on the exam, so it's not like we're gonna have a class

235
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:54.649
Marcus M Darden: the day before the exam, and then you're going to be tested on that stuff. So, they're trying to make this fair. So, that last two lectures of every quarter.

236
00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:09.779
Marcus M Darden: very little, if anything, of that will be on the exam. Maybe a little bit, but it's not going to be deep theory attack, and that's what the… even there, the material is not supposed to be deep theory, it's supposed to be light theory, so you've got some of the background on it.

237
00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:28.050
Marcus M Darden: So that's how it goes. In quarter one, we're going to be talking about contiguous data structures and hashing, then we'll get into sorting and priority queues, trees and graphs, and then some other higher-level algorithms, including graph algorithms and optimization stuff. That's the way the four quarters will go. There's going to be one exam for each quarter.

238
00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.300
Marcus M Darden: So there's 10 of them, sorry, 10 points.

239
00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:48.590
Marcus M Darden: Four of them, that's 40% of the grade. And each one of those exams is going to be basically over that quarter's material. So it's not going to be cumulative, though you may have learned something in a previous quarter that you just need as foundational knowledge.

240
00:34:48.590 --> 00:35:02.679
Marcus M Darden: The questions won't be directed toward the lecture material from another quarter. They'll be directed toward material from the current quarter, and there may be some additional support from there that you need. Eight labs, like I said, two per quarter.

241
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:16.710
Marcus M Darden: 2.5% each, that's 20% of your total grade. There's 4 projects, 10% each, and that's 40% of your grade. So there's our even 100. We should be able to get there. We've got some minimum competency. We like to…

242
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.839
Marcus M Darden: Make sure that you can do This course 3 different ways.

243
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.120
Marcus M Darden: You can do stuff with the projects, that means you can actually code.

244
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:37.640
Marcus M Darden: when you can pass exams, that means you know something, so you can do something, you can know something. And then, the labs are gonna be mostly about showing up and just getting after it, so…

245
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:49.800
Marcus M Darden: that one is really, can I get ahold of you? So if I can get ahold of you and make sure that you show up and stay on track with what we're doing, then that should be pretty easy to accomplish there.

246
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.940
Marcus M Darden: Alright?

247
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.630
Marcus M Darden: Rockin'.

248
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.459
Marcus M Darden: The labs are gonna be worksheet-driven, we think.

249
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:58.809
Marcus M Darden: We'll see.

250
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:09.670
Marcus M Darden: We're still working on this. Like I said, we've got some time. Each student is going to submit their own work. You can work in pairs, if you want to, in labs.

251
00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:28.060
Marcus M Darden: in the projects, you gotta write your own stuff, but you can work with a partner in labs, you don't have to worry about registering your partnership. You could maybe include your partner's name in your comments if there's code, but everybody has to turn in their own thing, so then we don't have to worry about trying to figure out which one thing that we graded gets divided into two layers of the…

252
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:36.430
Marcus M Darden: gradebook. So, just submit your own work, even if it's an exact copy of your partner's, that's fine. We won't be doing any cheat checking on that.

253
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:51.379
Marcus M Darden: Anything late for lab, we're just gonna knock 50% of it off, but that shouldn't be too difficult, because labs are going to be divided into multiple parts, usually like a worksheet, maybe some problems to work on, a quiz, or something like that, so if you take those.

254
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:58.910
Marcus M Darden: You know, 2.5%, and divide that into one or two different things, or two or three different things, like…

255
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.040
Marcus M Darden: So, each part is gonna be, like.

256
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:22.040
Marcus M Darden: 1% of your grade, and so if that ends up late, and you lose half a percent of your grade, it's not that big a deal. You could have done better, you could have got it there on time, but we don't need to be working back and forth about trying to contact me, and let's have a discussion about why you were late, and why I should definitely give you all the points, and just do it on time, or be okay with losing half a percent.

257
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.190
Marcus M Darden: Sound good?

258
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.179
Marcus M Darden: Trying to make this easy.

259
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:40.120
Marcus M Darden: All the lab pieces are due by 11.59, the day before the exam. So, I mean, it's kind of a tight schedule. If we have some real friction, we're there, let me know. Like I said, this is an experimental sort of approach to this course. Normally, this would have been a…

260
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:51.050
Marcus M Darden: 298, but… $3.98, but they wanted it right away, so here it is, live and active. No lab drops, you have to do them all. There's only 8 of them. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

261
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.660
Marcus M Darden: Why did you do that?

262
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.690
Marcus M Darden: Okay, it's back. I don't know what I did, so…

263
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:00.970
Marcus M Darden: Like I said, I've been using PowerPoint.

264
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.000
Marcus M Darden: 281 all the time.

265
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.620
Marcus M Darden: So here's the projects. They're 2 weeks, 2 weeks-ish?

266
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:24.630
Marcus M Darden: Steady progress is expected. We're gonna get an autograder up and running for you to put submissions into. The autograder should give you some feedback, what tests you're passing, what things work, what things don't. And we'll give you a couple of late days for projects.

267
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:30.949
Marcus M Darden: So, you can extend the project by a day, you're gonna have to probably email us to get that done.

268
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:44.349
Marcus M Darden: We'll figure that out, too. But the final grading run that we're gonna use will not give you the tests that you had already been practicing with, that's just to make sure that, everything actually works and it's not been coded to the test.

269
00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.750
Marcus M Darden: Pre-deadline score counts.

270
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:54.099
Marcus M Darden: That's the… that's the one we're gonna use, the best pre-deadline score, that's the… the version of the exam that we're gonna… or, sorry, the project that we're gonna grade.

271
00:38:55.410 --> 00:39:08.750
Marcus M Darden: The exams. Now, this is a new thing here. We've put in what's called the computer-based testing facility, and it is over in the Duderstadt building, down in the basement.

272
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:22.549
Marcus M Darden: And it's, like a standard computer lab, it's got a bunch of computers in there, but it runs tests. So you'll be able to go in there and take your test. Right now, I was able to let them give me space

273
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.300
Marcus M Darden: During our lecture.

274
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:39.319
Marcus M Darden: So, the days that we will be having exams, we won't have lecture, you'll just go to the CBTF, one of us or both of us will meet you there, and then you'll sit in a room, you'll take a test on a computer, and…

275
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:47.090
Marcus M Darden: it'll be fine, right? So, it'll be a multiple-choice test, and one…

276
00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:56.369
Marcus M Darden: coding problem. That's how I'm looking at doing it. So, this is closed book. You can take a sheet of notes if you need it.

277
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:06.489
Marcus M Darden: And the released exam days, like it says, no regular lecture, but you'll just be going there. So, the other thing is the fourth exam is gonna show up

278
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.639
Marcus M Darden: during… The final exam slot.

279
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:19.470
Marcus M Darden: But it won't be a cumulative final exam. It's just gonna be the fourth exam. So it's just gonna be the exam over the fourth quarter.

280
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:28.149
Marcus M Darden: We may find a way to use up a little bit extra time, because you will… I mean, we will be… we'll be in a room, so we're going to be doing the fourth exam on paper.

281
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:46.070
Marcus M Darden: Fourth exam's gonna be done on paper, but we won't… because there's just too many people to try to use the one facility with 25 or 30 seats for finals. So, we'll do the fourth one, during the registrar final exam period in the room that they give us, and that'll be that.

282
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.749
Marcus M Darden: Any questions on that? Is that making sense?

283
00:40:50.270 --> 00:41:02.089
Marcus M Darden: Sweet. At some point… yeah. Does the fourth exam, let's just stop coding as well? Like, it will be pen and paper, right? Yes, it will be pen and paper. You're gonna have to write some code.

284
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:13.679
Marcus M Darden: On a piece of paper. But, I mean, the problems are, you know, 15, 20 lines, and you won't… you won't have done much of it. But one of the things that we usually do in

285
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:19.920
Marcus M Darden: 281 Labs is we do some practice writing code on paper.

286
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:37.990
Marcus M Darden: as your… as your worksheet turn-ins, just so you have practice, and you've never written a function with a pencil in your life, I'd imagine, right? Very few people have. So, if you do that 3 or 4 times in lab, we'll… we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. I don't know, maybe we could… and the other alternative is we could see if we could get

287
00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.320
Marcus M Darden: the CBTF… Like, the last day of classes.

288
00:41:47.670 --> 00:42:01.149
Marcus M Darden: And then there would just be no final exam. So, if you're interested in that, let's… let's have a conversation on Ed and see what people think about that, if you want to keep going, and then we can just do it all computer, and then I'll also have to talk to them to see if I can get that day. But,

289
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.180
Marcus M Darden: Let's get that conversation started, and we'll figure out what we're gonna do.

290
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.370
Marcus M Darden: Make sense?

291
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.110
Marcus M Darden: Good-ish.

292
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:15.339
Marcus M Darden: What's that? Okay-ish, okay, alright. Like I said, we're gonna break some stuff around here.

293
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:21.620
Marcus M Darden: Academic integrity and AI policy.

294
00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:27.600
Marcus M Darden: So I'm sure you've heard it all about the AI at this point.

295
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:33.679
Marcus M Darden: I am a huge fan And super proponent.

296
00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:44.569
Marcus M Darden: But… I'm also… convinced That you have to be able to code to do this.

297
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:49.950
Marcus M Darden: Right? So… one of the things that…

298
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:55.499
Marcus M Darden: you know, we saw early on, when AI came on us.

299
00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:09.079
Marcus M Darden: is people stopped hiring, and people started getting laid off, and in CS, and in other fields all across the country. It's like, we don't need these people because AI can do so much for us.

300
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:19.409
Marcus M Darden: That is not going to change. That is going to continue to grow. But I don't feel like we are going to lose net jobs

301
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.740
Marcus M Darden: in CS.

302
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:29.200
Marcus M Darden: In software engineering, because… The jobs are going to change.

303
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:45.469
Marcus M Darden: When you are using a coding assistant, there's a number of them, Gemini, Claude Code, Codex, ADER, there's a bunch of them. They do some amazing stuff.

304
00:43:48.890 --> 00:44:06.900
Marcus M Darden: The people who can use them well are going to be the people with jobs. And I promise you, you won't be able to use them well if you can't understand what they produce. Like, your job as an agentic engineer is going to be, have this thing.

305
00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:15.380
Marcus M Darden: follow my directive, have it generate code, have it make updates, and then your job as an agentic engineer is going to be planning.

306
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:20.040
Marcus M Darden: It's going to be code review, it's going to be code curation, but…

307
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:37.530
Marcus M Darden: Planning code is really the planning parts. Planning code, code review and code curation, all of those things have code in them, and if you can't code, you can't do any of them. So, I really want you to do the absolute

308
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:46.580
Marcus M Darden: Best you can to struggle through everything that's difficult in this course, that's coding, and don't use those tools, because

309
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:53.400
Marcus M Darden: Humans learn by struggling. We don't learn much at all when things are easy.

310
00:44:53.690 --> 00:45:13.119
Marcus M Darden: We just don't. I mean, what keeps us alive? You're walking through the jungle, and a tiger jumps out and eats you, right? You see a friend get eaten, and then you're like, okay, I don't want that to happen to me, and I've learned something. You have to lose something, and so that's a bit of an extreme example. I'll agree, but…

311
00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:25.200
Marcus M Darden: Nothing comes easy. You say, hey, don't walk through there, you might get eaten by a tiger. Oh, yeah, sure, no problem. And then you do, and then you don't come back, and then your friend's like, oh, I guess I should listen.

312
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.880
Marcus M Darden: Right? So,

313
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:37.270
Marcus M Darden: don't let the tiger be you using AI. See how I brought that all the way back there? It's like, all the way back around. So,

314
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:56.600
Marcus M Darden: the AI is going to be very useful, and I would love to teach you more about it in another class, after this class, but you have to be able to code if you're going to be there. The people who can't code are the ones who are absolutely replaceable, 100%, by a terminal jockey with Claude in his hand.

315
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.850
Marcus M Darden: Or… their hand.

316
00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:05.859
Marcus M Darden: Or per hand. Or they don't have hands that could be, alternative input devices.

317
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.709
Marcus M Darden: I just go off on tangents, so…

318
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.259
Marcus M Darden: You need a little bell out there to just ring and just get me back on focus, but,

319
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:26.970
Marcus M Darden: Bottom line is, minimal assistance only. You're gonna get AI just all in your face. You can't even…

320
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:31.820
Marcus M Darden: buy a toothbrush, I swear, these days that doesn't have AI in it.

321
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:43.379
Marcus M Darden: So, it's gonna be everywhere. If you put in anything in your web browser, well, how do I do X? You're gonna get an AI summary of it. So, try to keep the AI down as low as you can. I mean, part of…

322
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:55.890
Marcus M Darden: my programming learning experience was, I don't know how to do what I want to do, I don't know how to figure out what I want to do.

323
00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:10.600
Marcus M Darden: How do I figure it out? I don't know. You know, in MIT, there was, like, there was a section next to the printers, it was about as big as this table, and the entire Unix manual was there in books, and if you wanted to know something.

324
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.480
Marcus M Darden: You just had to go find it in the book!

325
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:27.350
Marcus M Darden: Right? And that was when you're like, oh, I've been to that book so many times, I bet if I need something, it's gonna be in this book over here. And so, that's part of learning. Now we're gonna be robbed of that. You ask for help.

326
00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:28.410
Marcus M Darden: in…

327
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:48.589
Marcus M Darden: Google, you used to at least have to pick a web page, then go to the web page, and then read the web page. Now it's just like, no, no, here's all that you needed to know out of that, with some examples and some citations, just in case you wanted to go look. So, AI is already robbing us of some of the difficulty that really generates

328
00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:59.289
Marcus M Darden: strong learning experiences. So, just be really careful, try to keep your questions, even on Google, about how to do a thing to a minimum, right? Try to be like, well.

329
00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.390
Marcus M Darden: I know it's in the Python language.

330
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:27.300
Marcus M Darden: So, let me just go to the Python homepage, and it's gonna be painful. You're gonna be tooling around in this kind of documentation, but learning the overall structure of the language, and the libraries, and things that make Python Python, that is what's going to turn you into a coder, not being able to say, oh, I got this really great summary off of Google, didn't see any code, but the summary was so clear, I was able to do it.

331
00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:36.980
Marcus M Darden: you forget that you didn't come up with that summary. And later on, when you need to be able to use summarized information that you didn't summarize.

332
00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:41.039
Marcus M Darden: You don't have it. You gotta go back and look at your code if you're lucky.

333
00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:57.200
Marcus M Darden: So, try to use minimal assistance only. Stay on reference sites while you're coding. There's good reference sites for Python. Don't use any generated code or anything generated for code or submissions or…

334
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.250
Marcus M Darden: Question answers, all that stuff.

335
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.870
Marcus M Darden: We're gonna be using Python 3.13,

336
00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:11.639
Marcus M Darden: 313, Jupyter notebooks for lecture notes, and some Jupyter notebooks in lab.

337
00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:30.510
Marcus M Darden: Query Learn, which I talked about as the testing stuff over in this CBTF. Canvas, we'll do some assessments on there. And for the first half of the course, we're only going to use… well, I say only, but we've already installed one package. We're only going to use the standard library. So, when I installed

338
00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:45.099
Marcus M Darden: Jupyter, that's from outside of the standard library, so I'm trying to keep that down to a minimum. We're gonna use Jupyter, and we're also gonna use PyTest, which is an external library to help us run tests on our code. But outside of that.

339
00:49:45.100 --> 00:50:02.579
Marcus M Darden: We're just going to be using standard library stuff. In the second half, we'll get more into the data science-y side of it. We'll start using Pandas and NumPy, which are some more strong number-crunching libraries that are very popularly used, and definitely the kind of stuff that you would want to know coming out of this course.

340
00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.250
Marcus M Darden: But we'll get to that in the second half.

341
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:18.989
Marcus M Darden: Where to get help? Obviously, me and Rafe. Come to office hours, hit up Ed, I'll do my best to be on Ed and EX291 Admin, which…

342
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:26.340
Marcus M Darden: Gotta figure out where that email goes. I tried it, and I sent something. It does?

343
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:32.090
Marcus M Darden: Oh, because I didn't get it. I don't know, I didn't get it. I'm like, I said, where does this email end up?

344
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.270
Marcus M Darden: Nothing. Okay, well, that's good.

345
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:43.580
Marcus M Darden: He's getting it. There we go. So, I gotta put myself on there so I can be of assistance. As well, we have,

346
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:50.740
Marcus M Darden: a university administrative support personnel as well. Her name is Rose. You probably won't have to deal with her too much.

347
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.730
Marcus M Darden: But Rose is helping us too, so…

348
00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.889
Marcus M Darden: she'll help with anything there, I can see if I can put her on that email as well. If all the office hours conflict.

349
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:07.670
Marcus M Darden: you gotta maybe try to find a way to contact us. So, I've got office hours for 281,

350
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:12.859
Marcus M Darden: And… I'm just gonna do the 281, 291 office hours with…

351
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.719
Marcus M Darden: Them as well, just because there's only 11 of you and…

352
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:28.270
Marcus M Darden: I don't know, 700 of them. So I've got office hours on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

353
00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:47.260
Marcus M Darden: And if it turns into a situation where, like I said, come to me, talk about some things. If, like, it's just always way too crowded in 281, 291 office hours, and you're like, well, we need Wednesdays, then I'll come in on Wednesdays and then give you something. But let's make sure that we have a time to get together. Rafe has got office hours.

354
00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:55.140
Marcus M Darden: as well, and, we should be able to get you through that. So, let's make sure that these things work.

355
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.530
Marcus M Darden: Alright, are we halfway through?

356
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:03.099
Marcus M Darden: Not bad, not bad. It should be 340. It's 351.

357
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:11.470
Marcus M Darden: Only 11 minutes behind after the entire… slides, PDF, HTML fiasco, so…

358
00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:18.430
Marcus M Darden: Alright, we got a couple of minutes here. I'm gonna go grab some water, and I will be right back. Feel free to stand, stretch.

359
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:32.039
Marcus M Darden: Going to the bathroom, find us back.

360
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:38.430
Marcus M Darden: But it makes sense to you when you don't even have a position in business.

361
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:55.240
Marcus M Darden: I have to figure out why Darden… he needs to, like, fix my hiring. Yeah, I don't… Yeah.

362
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.630
Marcus M Darden: How do you have linker errors? How do you do we? 42?

363
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:18.840
Marcus M Darden: Oh, okay. I could not remember what it was. Because we installed… Are you speaking with this project?

364
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.239
Marcus M Darden: Yeah, because it's zero plus plus 15.

365
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.959
Marcus M Darden: So, if you're like something, it dies.

366
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:43.570
Marcus M Darden: Why don't these link? It's these do. It does not link things.

367
00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:52.349
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so it's not linking to something that's in the same file.

368
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:58.579
Marcus M Darden: It's 5 minutes in your screen.

369
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.269
Marcus M Darden: What's the idea for it.

370
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:07.470
Marcus M Darden: Oh, I didn't really do this. Obviously, we've been floating something, it's like, I think one and a half.

371
00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:16.240
Marcus M Darden: we're saving… we're saving minutes everywhere. All right, so… Now we're into the… Python section.

372
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:31.829
Marcus M Darden: So, this is just some basic Python, some crash core stuff. If this stuff was all way too easy, we could be done out of here in 20 minutes, because after this is what I got for the day. So, we're just going to make sure that we understand some core syntax stuff.

373
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:38.089
Marcus M Darden: And make sure that you're going to be able to do some of the basic stuff that you need to do to write these projects.

374
00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.230
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

375
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:51.620
Marcus M Darden: All right. Functions, conditionals, and loops, although I should have put that in conditionals, functions, conditionals, loops, and functions order.

376
00:54:53.950 --> 00:55:00.930
Marcus M Darden: So, that you've all been here doing some Python. How many people have also done C++ or CQ?

377
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:07.410
Marcus M Darden: Anybody? I've only done C++, not Python. Okay, so you're… you're no Python, just all…

378
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:24.209
Marcus M Darden: That's what I'm saying, you haven't done no Python. No Python, just C++. Okay, great. Well, this slide is exactly for you. It's okay. That's what I said, we didn't know what people were gonna come in knowing. So, just reminders.

379
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:28.350
Marcus M Darden: for those of you that have been in Python, and for you who haven't.

380
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:40.350
Marcus M Darden: White space matters in Python, unlike in C++. So, we don't have curly braces, we have indent and outdent. You have to be regular with that, the Python standard.

381
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:51.569
Marcus M Darden: is two space… 4 spaces. You can use fewer if you want, but it has to be regular. So this is just a list of our real common ones. We've got our conditionals, which is if

382
00:55:51.830 --> 00:56:05.490
Marcus M Darden: And we don't have to put parentheses around it, we just have any expression that evaluates to a particular value. If it's true-ish, then we do the stuff inside the block. If it's zero or false-ish, then we don't.

383
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.950
Marcus M Darden: And it's gonna look like if some expression, and then a colon.

384
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:28.970
Marcus M Darden: Then it says, use a colon and indent to begin a block. So we put a colon on the previous line, we come down line and indent, and everything there is inside the block as long as we stay at that indent level. Even if we have blank lines in the indent level, it's still not a problem, but as soon as we outdent, then that's the end of the block.

385
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:38.890
Marcus M Darden: So, while loops work similar to if statements. It's just going to repeat everything inside the block until failure, whereas the if statement just goes through the block once.

386
00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:54.290
Marcus M Darden: For loops. We know what a for loop is if you know a language. There's a couple of different ways that, you can use for loops in C++ now. There was originally just the one way, which was a count-controlled for loop, so we always used

387
00:56:54.690 --> 00:57:06.120
Marcus M Darden: for loops to be count controlled, when we knew how many things there were, and then we used while loops to be event controlled, and we didn't know how many times we were gonna do it. We're just gonna do this until something happens.

388
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:10.780
Marcus M Darden: So that's what while loops are for. They're for things that aren't counted.

389
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:19.189
Marcus M Darden: So, the form item in a list, that is a form of…

390
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:38.579
Marcus M Darden: account control loop, because you're going to do it once for the number of things in the loop, but the version of it doesn't require you to actually even know what that number is, it just promises to process all of them. So, those are now included in C++, known as a range-based for loop. It's just a very similar syntax.

391
00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:52.500
Marcus M Darden: Here is what would look like a count-controlled loop in Python. So, I in range 10, this is a generator that is going to give me the values 0 through 9.

392
00:57:52.540 --> 00:58:08.880
Marcus M Darden: And so, this would actually do this just like a 4I equals 0, i less than 10, plus plus i. This one works just like that. So, then I can use the i inside there, and it has on those individual values. So, that's… it's just a less… because of the way Python works.

393
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:17.340
Marcus M Darden: it's less… the least used loop that we have, actually. It's, like, the primary loop in C++ is count-controlled I loops, but…

394
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:22.030
Marcus M Darden: You're more likely to use a range base for loop.

395
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:34.399
Marcus M Darden: in Python, or a comprehension, which is sort of unique to Python, at least from a C++ standpoint. So comprehensions process a whole list, or a whole iterable container.

396
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:52.399
Marcus M Darden: We'll do some checking on that. And then, the same thing for function here. I'm gonna say this def keyword is how I create a function. In C or C++, I gotta start with the return type, and then the function name, since we don't really worry about return types.

397
00:58:52.610 --> 00:59:09.769
Marcus M Darden: at the execution level, we can just say, define this function. So def is short for define, define, function name, the whatever parameters we have, same sort of thing, colon, and then we come down and indent, and everything that's indented at that level is inside of that function.

398
00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:16.120
Marcus M Darden: Right? Once I'm done, just like here on the slide, I out-dent To end the block.

399
00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:24.069
Marcus M Darden: blocks have scope, just like C++, so you can declare something within a block that's only available within the block.

400
00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:35.989
Marcus M Darden: It's like a 4I equals 0 loop in C++, that I is only active inside of that context, and then once you leave the 4 context, the i is gone. Same thing with blocks.

401
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:42.729
Marcus M Darden: Conditionals, of course, have else. If else.

402
00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:46.200
Marcus M Darden: But so do our loops.

403
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:58.199
Marcus M Darden: Which is a little bit different thing. So, you can tack on an else outside of a loop, and the else is what happens when the loop condition fails.

404
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:07.739
Marcus M Darden: So you can think of this as, like, the else is going to happen. So I can say, while I'm processing these 10 things, do this. And then the else…

405
01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:19.270
Marcus M Darden: that's tacked onto the while loop happens when I'm done while looping. So, if you want to do some sort of cleanup things, maybe you set something up, and then while I've got to process it.

406
01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:34.900
Marcus M Darden: else, now clean it up, and I'm out. So, it works just like an if-else, but the loop part always happens as many loop times as it would, so you can think of that as really just the same structure as if-else, but with repetition.

407
01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.179
Marcus M Darden: In the wild, or in the fork.

408
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:54.449
Marcus M Darden: So conditional and loops can use else, and because they don't use that crazy two-word syntax like C++, else if is now just one keyword, and it's this thing here. ELIF.

409
01:00:54.490 --> 01:01:07.320
Marcus M Darden: So, it's a single keyword, so if you want to have multiple conditionals, you can say, if A is less than 100, L if A is less than 50, L if A is less than 25, else.

410
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:20.000
Marcus M Darden: And so, it's just like if, else, else, else, else. It's just like it's if, else, if, else, if, else, if, else. It's just if, elf, elif, eleph, else.

411
01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:27.630
Marcus M Darden: So, that's your major… syntactical…

412
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:35.770
Marcus M Darden: update on Python or C++. There's a Learn Python LearnPython.com.

413
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.880
Marcus M Darden: learnpython.org.

414
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:44.840
Marcus M Darden: really… really friendly site that I… that I've seen in the past.

415
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:49.959
Marcus M Darden: Tom? Dot org.org, okay. LearnBython.org, great place to look.

416
01:01:50.350 --> 01:01:55.199
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, I've got this, nifty little…

417
01:01:55.330 --> 01:02:04.020
Marcus M Darden: down arrow. See this? It even jumps every once in a while, let me know that it's there. So, what this does is I can go to…

418
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:16.859
Marcus M Darden: another cell on this slide. It just looks like the next cell for those of you that are looking at the notebook. But for me, it's an off-ramp. If you ever see me up here, and I go through one of those without going down.

419
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:27.340
Marcus M Darden: let me know, because I'm… I gotta get used to seeing that. So, here we see some code. This is some function, and it's always good to read code. Reading code is…

420
01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:37.290
Marcus M Darden: the best practice for writing code. My son is 8 years old, and trying to get him to do more writing, and he's just writing, and, you know, his spelling is atrocious.

421
01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:54.039
Marcus M Darden: his age, right? But I'm like, I told him, don't worry about spelling, because you're not going to learn how to spell by writing, right? If you can't do it, you can't do it. Doing more of it is not going to make you better in that particular case. Now, can't make baskets. Shooting more baskets will get you better, but…

422
01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:04.149
Marcus M Darden: If you don't know how to spell it, writing it multiple times is not going to make your spelling right. But reading will, so I said, okay, just keep writing, and when you read more, you'll get better, so…

423
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.709
Marcus M Darden: You're gonna have to read some code, you should find as much code as you can.

424
01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:21.330
Marcus M Darden: That's not somebody else's solution, mind you. So, but there's plenty of stuff out on… out online, like, if you go to tutorial sites, you know, if you want to find some,

425
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:38.150
Marcus M Darden: Find some repo that does something interesting on GitHub. Something that interests you, that you might be interested in on your computer, or in your home, or in your hobbies. There's somebody that's doing something. Go find somebody who's got a repo dedicated to that in Python, and then just…

426
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:51.730
Marcus M Darden: Start trying to wade your way through their codebase and say, well, what are they doing? How are they using functions? How are they using decorators? We'll talk about that later. How are they using modules? Like, all kind of stuff. So, a lot of my…

427
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:58.520
Marcus M Darden: Analogies are gonna come from sports, And… Music.

428
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.420
Marcus M Darden: Athlete and a musician.

429
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.980
Marcus M Darden: But…

430
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:20.469
Marcus M Darden: Anybody who does their craft and does their craft well has a couple of different modalities. Musicians, they practice a lot. You're not going to be a good musician unless you practice a lot. But then, when they're not practicing, most musicians are spending a lot of time listening to music.

431
01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:30.370
Marcus M Darden: Basketball players are on the court, they're, you know, in the weight room, but then when they're not, they're spending a lot of time watching game film.

432
01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:42.660
Marcus M Darden: They're watching other people play basketball. So, the same thing is true. If you're trying to learn how to code, you're going to be writing a lot of code, but you're not going to get very… you're not going to get better very fast.

433
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:59.139
Marcus M Darden: Until you see more code. So, having a chance to go read more code is also one of the greatest things, especially when you see something that you have no idea what that means. Like, I don't even know what was done there. Now, that's, you know, especially if it's somebody else's code that's not related to your project.

434
01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:17.970
Marcus M Darden: That's a perfectly good reason to use some AI, but like, dump this into a browser and be like, what is happening here? And then say, oh, it's this function that calls blah blah blah blah, this is known as list print creation, or whatever it's gonna say. Then you can go say, okay, well, now let me go see on the Python site what I should be focusing on to figure out what's going on there, so…

435
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:27.659
Marcus M Darden: This is a perfectly good Python function there. We see it's, starts with a defined keyword. Our keywords all show up nice and green there in this highlighting.

436
01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:38.289
Marcus M Darden: I think there's only 37 keywords in Python, so it's a pretty short language in terms of learning. Once you learn the 37 keywords, man, I would say you could probably get by with

437
01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:41.430
Marcus M Darden: Probably less than half of those.

438
01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.430
Marcus M Darden: I don't know if I use more than half of them on a regular basis, but…

439
01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:53.260
Marcus M Darden: Define. Now I got a function. This function is named clip points. It takes two arguments, points and cap.

440
01:05:55.070 --> 01:06:01.759
Marcus M Darden: We're gonna try to clip some points above some cap, and then the colon says, let's get this function going.

441
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:15.480
Marcus M Darden: come down and start indenting, we're indented four spaces, and I've got a variable assignment there in line 2, total equals 0, and then I've got a for loop, and we see this is a range-based for loop, it's going to go over all of the things

442
01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.219
Marcus M Darden: in that container for PN points.

443
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:31.240
Marcus M Darden: If P is greater than cap, we've got the colon, we come in a block and do the if stuff, total plus equals cap. Otherwise, if it's not, then I'm gonna say total plus equals P.

444
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:38.280
Marcus M Darden: So all we're going to do is sum these… things pop.

445
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:47.499
Marcus M Darden: We're clipping them at that maximum. So, I would add 24, and I would add 12, but since 35 is over 30, I'm only going to add 30.

446
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:58.170
Marcus M Darden: And that's what this function does. You can give it a list of however many things you want it to have, or some generator that creates them, and then some cap that says anything above this

447
01:06:58.610 --> 01:06:59.999
Marcus M Darden: Just use that.

448
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:04.510
Marcus M Darden: So, in this one, we see a function defined.

449
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:14.239
Marcus M Darden: and then we see that function call right here. We just called print with a call to clip points, so then it's gonna print that number for us.

450
01:07:14.370 --> 01:07:18.399
Marcus M Darden: And… I can run this, right?

451
01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:22.920
Marcus M Darden: How do I run it? Do I hit the… Yes!

452
01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.319
Marcus M Darden: Nailed it!

453
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:25.720
Marcus M Darden: First drawing.

454
01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.230
Marcus M Darden: Goodness.

455
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.410
Marcus M Darden: All right.

456
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:35.389
Marcus M Darden: So, those of you that have this up and running in notebook mode, all I did is I hit, like, Command-Enter.

457
01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:48.459
Marcus M Darden: And it executed everything in this context. And you see there, now that little slur brackets thing says it's got a 1 in there, because we've executed this code. So, there we go. It rang.

458
01:07:49.100 --> 01:08:00.079
Marcus M Darden: We call the print function. The print function had as its argument the return value of a call to clip points with those three values and the cat, and… there we go.

459
01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:03.370
Marcus M Darden: Good.

460
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:05.780
Marcus M Darden: What questions do we have about this?

461
01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:17.569
Marcus M Darden: It's a pretty straightforward one, right? We do have a for loop in there, but, you know, we've got… we've got 3 of our… the first three things that we looked at, right? So, we've got a conditional.

462
01:08:18.210 --> 01:08:22.390
Marcus M Darden: With a… with a default, if and else. We've got a…

463
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:30.229
Marcus M Darden: And we've got a function. So, all of our three major control structures are taken care of here.

464
01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:58.409
Marcus M Darden: There we go. Exercise 1. This is where you're going to write a function in your notebook. You will have a cell that's right after this one. You can see it, I can't. But what I want you to do is write some function above threshold, and just like the previous one takes a collection of values.

465
01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:02.379
Marcus M Darden: And then…

466
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:10.529
Marcus M Darden: That T, which is my threshold value. So, returns a list of the values that are greater than T.

467
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:15.919
Marcus M Darden: We haven't really talked about this, you can make an empty loop. An empty…

468
01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.290
Marcus M Darden: You can make an empty list.

469
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:23.619
Marcus M Darden: Just by setting a variable equal to There are four records.

470
01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:32.080
Marcus M Darden: Then, you can append stuff, To that list with… Bush.

471
01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.819
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

472
01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:39.899
Marcus M Darden: A pen. It's a pen. So, so it was a,

473
01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:43.589
Marcus M Darden: And I think I can go down here, so I'll go down…

474
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:52.100
Marcus M Darden: And there we go. So, there's what your task is. Jump in this thing, and take a couple of minutes, and see if you can't write

475
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.399
Marcus M Darden: this function.

476
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:58.079
Marcus M Darden: Alright, then I'll come back and write it, and we'll see how we all did begin.

477
01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.110
Marcus M Darden: iPhone doesn't actually have scope.

478
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.160
Marcus M Darden: You can do vigorous things.

479
01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.490
Marcus M Darden: You can define stuff in Bright, and then you should use it after.

480
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:33.610
Marcus M Darden: Python doesn't care. Because it exists, so it doesn't… Yeah.

481
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:37.630
Marcus M Darden: Yeah, alright, that makes sense. I guess I had my mic off, didn't I?

482
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:40.959
Marcus M Darden: I never turned it back on after I came back from the water.

483
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:44.680
Marcus M Darden: Hopefully that won't mess up the video too much.

484
01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.480
Marcus M Darden: Is it…

485
01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:49.890
Marcus M Darden: Down to 10 minutes, so… I gotta speed up just a little. Alright, I'm gonna get started on it. So, when I'm in here, I'm gonna do what we did on the previous side. We saw the function was defined as, and we're supposed to define something that tells me exactly what it should look like.

486
01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:54.250
Marcus M Darden: Values… T.

487
01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.240
Marcus M Darden: Perfect. And Python automatically indents for me, and if I want to.

488
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:12.010
Marcus M Darden: I can just say pass. If I hit pass in there, you'll see that my function actually runs pass as, like, a no-op, so…

489
01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:22.670
Marcus M Darden: it at least allowed me to indent and have something, because you can't just have the colon and nothing. So, here I've basically stubbed the function out, the function does nothing.

490
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:28.029
Marcus M Darden: So, I think when I run this, let me uncomment this.

491
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.330
Marcus M Darden: Those hashes are comments, by the way.

492
01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.439
Marcus M Darden: There we go.

493
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.760
Marcus M Darden: So, the pass…

494
01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:42.769
Marcus M Darden: just didn't do anything. So the function got called, and when nothing happens in Python, none is what gets returned.

495
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:57.720
Marcus M Darden: So, the print statement says, do whatever above threshold gives us, and above threshold gave us none, because I didn't do anything, I just did a pass. So, now I've got something that works, and this is a very important technique as you're trying to build something. Get through the function.

496
01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:10.449
Marcus M Darden: Even if the function doesn't do everything that you want it to do, make sure that the thing runs, and then you go back and you stretch it out a little bit, do a little bit more, do a little bit more, and then you get something out of it. So,

497
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:17.289
Marcus M Darden: Another thing I could do is I could just say, well, you wanted me to return some values, what if I just return all the values?

498
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.580
Marcus M Darden: it's not right

499
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:33.010
Marcus M Darden: But, once again, it's code that's working. So, these are techniques that you use as you build your way up to writing more complicated things that actually work. You know, I'm gonna have to do something like that. So, I'm gonna say…

500
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.450
Marcus M Darden: Let's give myself a return value.

501
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.550
Marcus M Darden: I'm just gonna call it answer.

502
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:47.780
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna set that equal to an empty list. So now, I can come in there and say, instead of using values, what if I just return the answer?

503
01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:49.540
Marcus M Darden: Perfect.

504
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:51.120
Marcus M Darden: It's working?

505
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.569
Marcus M Darden: It's not doing what I want, but it ain't broke.

506
01:13:55.190 --> 01:14:04.400
Marcus M Darden: Well, it's not doing what I want, but it runs. Let's go there, okay. So, we do the same thing in this one, we're gonna have to look at each one of them, so I'm gonna go ahead and write this.

507
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:08.809
Marcus M Darden: In a really readable way for the humans.

508
01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:15.060
Marcus M Darden: For value in values, like to have these nice plural names on collections.

509
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:25.559
Marcus M Darden: go for a singular name when I'm looking at one of them. For value in values, and we say, if value is greater than

510
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:33.650
Marcus M Darden: threshold, Then, answer, append… Value.

511
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:37.660
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

512
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.980
Marcus M Darden: And it works.

513
01:14:42.970 --> 01:14:46.209
Marcus M Darden: This one, I didn't need an else, because if…

514
01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.690
Marcus M Darden: It's not greater than the threshold, I just leave it alone.

515
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:55.870
Marcus M Darden: So, this one's a little simpler than the previous function, but hopefully you get something like this.

516
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.160
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

517
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:00.540
Marcus M Darden: Excellent. Any questions on this one?

518
01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.739
Marcus M Darden: Alright, imports and modules.

519
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.949
Marcus M Darden: Python uses modules.

520
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:18.820
Marcus M Darden: And it's one of the greatest things about Python. So here, we're going to import statistics, and…

521
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:26.090
Marcus M Darden: Compute the median, And the standard deviation for a list.

522
01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:45.010
Marcus M Darden: there's multiple syntaxes for import. You can just say import math, and it'll take an entire module, and everything that's in the module gets imported, right? But it lives inside of the name of the thing that you imported. So if I say import math.

523
01:15:45.010 --> 01:15:53.060
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna have to use the dots to get stuff out of it. So I say math.squareroot is where this new function that I imported from math lives.

524
01:15:53.630 --> 01:16:01.890
Marcus M Darden: There's another way that I can use imports, you can see there, and the second one is, like, import really long module name as RLMN.

525
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:15.039
Marcus M Darden: So you can rename these things as you like. Some people do that, we'll see that. It's pretty common when we use some stuff later, like NumPy and Pandas. People always just use the same two-letter abbreviation

526
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:26.530
Marcus M Darden: import pandas as PD, right? Import NumPy as NP. So that's really… you're not… you're never really looking at a modulane that's that long, but some people like to make things a little bit…

527
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:33.870
Marcus M Darden: cleaner. So, that's something there, that's called module aliasing. It's pretty… you use some common shorthands on there. From math.

528
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:44.189
Marcus M Darden: Now, if I don't want to import everything in math, but I just want to get some subset of it, I can tell it exactly what to import. So I've said, from math, import only pi and square root.

529
01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:56.230
Marcus M Darden: So pi isn't a function, pi is a constant. Square root is a function, whereas before, when I said import math, I had to say math.square root. Since I've named it in the import, now I can say, well, I can just use square root.

530
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.719
Marcus M Darden: Because I already named it.

531
01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:07.150
Marcus M Darden: Right? And then, just as before, you can alias objects, so I can say, from math, import square root as…

532
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:16.270
Marcus M Darden: whatever I want to name things. So, in general, it's not a good idea to do a whole bunch of as-ing.

533
01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:19.210
Marcus M Darden: Just because it makes people nuts.

534
01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:40.389
Marcus M Darden: But if you're… if you're in a particular scope, and people are always using the same thing, like when we look at NumPy and Pandas, people always abbreviate those things. So, if somebody that's never seen your code looks at your code, like, oh, NP, they must be using NumPy, that's understandable, but, like, if you just decide to call square root, you know, square underscore root, people are gonna be like.

535
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:53.869
Marcus M Darden: what function is this? Where did they get that function? And you never want people looking at your code and scratching their head, and scrolling back up to see what the hell did they do? Why did they do this? And you get people doing this to your…

536
01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:58.569
Marcus M Darden: you're back. But, it can be done.

537
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:14.020
Marcus M Darden: And then this last one says, from math, import asterisk, which is basically import everything. So it takes all of the objects and dumps them into your namespace. So now, you can't write a variable named pi, which you might have wanted to do.

538
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:29.570
Marcus M Darden: Or if you do, you're overwriting something, and there could be a function there, you might not be using the function you think you're using if you say, import everything from this library and import everything from that library. If those two libraries have a function called square root, whoever gets their last wins.

539
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.349
Marcus M Darden: And hopefully they're doing the same thing, hopefully square root is square root, but if the functions are less,

540
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:44.870
Marcus M Darden: the functions are less, specific, then you might get different things. One calculates area in square meters, one calculates area in square feet, and then your

541
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:54.109
Marcus M Darden: rocket crash lands on Mars, and you think, oh, I meant meters. You were thinking feet? Oh, my bad.

542
01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.120
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, import statistics.

543
01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:03.600
Marcus M Darden: and compute… the median.

544
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:10.000
Marcus M Darden: So now we might have to do a little bit of work there. How do I… Git?

545
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.970
Marcus M Darden: Medium.

546
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:21.240
Marcus M Darden: I'm just going for it, right? So, import… Statistics.

547
01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:31.720
Marcus M Darden: If I can do it that way, and then I will have something like… Statistics… dot median.

548
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:39.919
Marcus M Darden: If I run that, it's like, yes, there's a function called statistics.median. It looks like you give it data.

549
01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:41.030
Marcus M Darden: Sweet.

550
01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:50.900
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so I'm gonna go up here and uncomment values, so now I have them. I'm gonna call median on Values.

551
01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:54.020
Marcus M Darden: And run it.

552
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:55.420
Marcus M Darden: There we go.

553
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.819
Marcus M Darden: So the median on those things is a 9, which is correct.

554
01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:02.429
Marcus M Darden: What about this other thing that it asks me to do?

555
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.160
Marcus M Darden: They said we wanted this in a print statement.

556
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:17.389
Marcus M Darden: So that's there. What about… Statistics… PST Dev.

557
01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.430
Marcus M Darden: So yeah, it says that is a function, this object.

558
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:36.449
Marcus M Darden: So I printed the 9 from this line, and then when this statement here gets executed, it's just like, what is that? Evaluate this. It says, well, this evaluates to an object, and then…

559
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:55.309
Marcus M Darden: Since that was the last thing it got out of there, it showed up for me, though. So there is some function there that I can give some data, so I'm going to try the same thing by slapping values in there, and I don't have a mu that I want to use, but there we go. And so they wanted us to do some printing on that, so I'm going to go back here, and then…

560
01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.200
Marcus M Darden: Wrap that in…

561
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:04.709
Marcus M Darden: print statement, and we see that. So, a slight difference, did you see that really quickly when I hit that enter, that execution?

562
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.369
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna paste it back in there, and take the print off.

563
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:13.150
Marcus M Darden: Oh, I guess I gotta do it last.

564
01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:15.600
Marcus M Darden: No!

565
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:27.740
Marcus M Darden: So these two things are displayed.

566
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:31.399
Marcus M Darden: This is returned.

567
01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:34.420
Marcus M Darden: You see, it says.

568
01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:42.169
Marcus M Darden: as my input on number 14, the output was this, because it was the last thing that I said.

569
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:47.020
Marcus M Darden: So the script executes, and then the last thing that's in the script is what the script returns.

570
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.709
Marcus M Darden: I think they got clasped.

571
01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:02.300
Marcus M Darden: It goes into classes here. Check that out. I'll pop in and hit this stuff at the beginning of…

572
01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:04.509
Marcus M Darden: lecture on Tuesday.

573
01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.939
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so there we are.

574
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:15.889
Marcus M Darden: Save your notebook with the stuff that you did get done. Try pushing that before we go.

575
01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:26.350
Marcus M Darden: And then also, when you get a chance later tonight, try to walk through the rest of the exercises and see if you're good with it, alright? We'll be in contact, and…

576
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:45.440
Marcus M Darden: I think that's what we have. Tomorrow, there is lab. It's optional, though if you want to come in and make sure that all of your setups are working, you've got virtual environments working, you want to make sure that you've got VS Code configured the way that we're going to be using it in class.

577
01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:50.099
Marcus M Darden: Rafe will be there, I might be able to get over there, I've got office hours at that time, too, so…

578
01:22:50.370 --> 01:23:04.559
Marcus M Darden: But it's right downstairs, so we'll see. So, tomorrow, if you want to show up in 1303 Eaks, Rafe will be there for sure, and probably, maybe another half of those guys as well. It's just always frowns.

579
01:23:04.890 --> 01:23:11.700
Marcus M Darden: So, that's it. All right, have a good one, and come talk to me about anything that you need to let me know. Thanks.

580
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:23.879
Marcus M Darden: 496 a week.

581
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:28.760
Marcus M Darden: Those are being offered in the community.
