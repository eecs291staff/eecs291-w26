1
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.809
Marcus M Darden: All right. Well… Here we are again.

2
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.979
Marcus M Darden: Seems to be just about everything I need for class here.

3
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.790
Marcus M Darden: re… Did this, scheduling here, so we've got…

4
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.000
Marcus M Darden: We're gonna get back to the Lecture 1 stuff.

5
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.400
Marcus M Darden: That we didn't get to yesterday, after we do some Git stuff. So, that should bring us…

6
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.030
Marcus M Darden: Hopefully, to a place where we can at least have some decent conversations, or, you know, leave you at a position where you can do some…

7
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.699
Marcus M Darden: Decent searching on your own to figure out what you need to know.

8
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.409
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so what I need first off is…

9
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.349
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna go ahead and move it to that directory, let's go.

10
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.619
Marcus M Darden: Is that it? Okay. Alright, so here are…

11
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:23.160
Marcus M Darden: the files that I have, and this is a directory that should be like the one that you have. So if you haven't received all of these files.

12
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:40.970
Marcus M Darden: you can change into that directory and do a git pull. So you should do this from the command line. We'll go over that if you haven't figured that out yet in a second. But I do have the Lecture 0 stuff there, both pre and presented. I've got the Lecture 1 stuff, both pre and presented. Now I've added this Lecture XX,

13
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.329
Marcus M Darden: Git tutorial, so that's what I'm going to go through today, if you want to Fire up your…

14
00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:07.739
Marcus M Darden: I might on notebook and look at it. I've also been told that you can do that in Visual Studio Code, so you can look at notebooks right in Visual Studio Code, which is nice. So there's that. Here's the transcripts of the two lectures that we've already had. I talked about those. Those are the slides that I'm not going to be dealing with.

15
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:21.839
Marcus M Darden: that just kind of live in the area now. Oh, you can see them all, there's the Lecture 0 slides, the Lecture 1 slides, and now there's the Lecture 2, sorry, the Lecture XX slide. So this is supposed to be, like, a half-lecture

16
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.650
Marcus M Darden: We can get back to the stuff from Lecture 1, so the,

17
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.070
Marcus M Darden: This thing is only designed to be about half a lecture.

18
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.130
Marcus M Darden: There we go. So yeah, it doesn't really have a serial number, so I just called it LectureXX.

19
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.080
Marcus M Darden: So it doesn't have a number.

20
00:03:45.590 --> 00:04:01.220
Marcus M Darden: But it's the intro to Git, and we'll do a bunch of, live demo and some guided practice stuff. What we're trying to do is basically figure out how to get Git workflows together. What do I do to use Git? What do I learn from Git? What do I get from Git?

21
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.919
Marcus M Darden: How do I use it?

22
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.030
Marcus M Darden: For now, I guess I'll put that over there until I need some note-taking stuff over here.

23
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.660
Marcus M Darden: Power that…

24
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.880
Marcus M Darden: a new note over here, so I'm ready.

25
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.600
Marcus M Darden: And… let's make sure we've got a decent terminal.

26
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.519
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, got a terminal here so I can do some stuff at terminal level. We'll mostly be looking at slides, so let me,

27
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.640
Marcus M Darden: This over to its own.

28
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:29.530
Marcus M Darden: Sure.

29
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:37.070
Marcus M Darden: I can come over here and… Alright, there we go.

30
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.540
Marcus M Darden: Ready to go. Questions before we get started? Everybody's in place, in good shape?

31
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.880
Marcus M Darden: So, we're trying to figure out why do we use version control and what Git is.

32
00:05:50.380 --> 00:06:04.660
Marcus M Darden: It's really challenging. The challenging part of Git is the new mental model that you probably haven't dealt with in the past. So once we figure out what that is, it starts to get a little bit easier. There's three primary areas, a fourth, once we start using remotes.

33
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:14.999
Marcus M Darden: We're gonna make sure that it's installed and configured, then we're gonna start a repo and track some files, and just do some staging and committing and practice, figure out how to undo some things, and…

34
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:29.339
Marcus M Darden: learn more when we need to learn something, and then we'll take a brief glance at remotes, and then we'll move on. All right? So, at the end, we hope we can explain why version control exists. We want to be able to create Git repos and make clean commits.

35
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:45.120
Marcus M Darden: One of the cool things about it is it's like a time machine, but you've got this long log of everything that you've done in it, and that's very cool. So, you have to learn how to read that, and also how to fix small mistakes.

36
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.089
Marcus M Darden: There's a ton of things I could easily teach probably a full semester on Git.

37
00:06:52.070 --> 00:07:05.499
Marcus M Darden: Plus, we've got a half lecture. So, we're gonna try to keep our Git use real straightforward and not get too off the rails. I will be, throughout the semester, probably adding more to your Git skills, just because

38
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.000
Marcus M Darden: It's good to have them. I'll just throw a little block in at the beginning of a lecture here and there to make sure we've got a new skill that we need.

39
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.230
Marcus M Darden: And, finding help when we need it.

40
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.919
Marcus M Darden: First of all, why do we use final version control?

41
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.410
Marcus M Darden: I remember back in the day, we would just…

42
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:31.050
Marcus M Darden: make a copy of everything, then make another copy of everything, and you would end up with some file that looks like final, final.

43
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:43.600
Marcus M Darden: final, final number one, and final, final number two. Here, this one was, like, final, final, really final, and so you're doing this so that you're like, oh, I made this edit, because you're trying to save some previous

44
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.749
Marcus M Darden: snapshot, essentially. That's the only reason why you keep modifying this.

45
00:07:48.750 --> 00:08:05.219
Marcus M Darden: You say, there might be something good in this previous snapshot. I want to try something, so I don't want to blow that away. Let me just copy it over and do that. So, it can be really messy. We would love to not have to do that. And it takes a little bit of practice, but once you're into Git, you're just like, I'm just trying anything. I just…

46
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.569
Marcus M Darden: I've got a… checkpoints that I can go back to.

47
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.639
Marcus M Darden: I don't like what I did, just easily just undo it.

48
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.720
Marcus M Darden: So we can recover from our mistakes by time traveling, which is nice.

49
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:29.839
Marcus M Darden: We can collaborate, when we do collaborate, start working with a teammate or a larger team. It's good to be able to say, well, I can work on this while you're working on it, and I won't change what you've changed.

50
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:42.960
Marcus M Darden: And then the last thing that you can do pretty easily, which won't be that important when you're working all by yourself for the most of the semester, is when you have multiple people in there, you can see who did what.

51
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:57.529
Marcus M Darden: It's actually a command called git blame, and it will show you every line of a file and who wrote that line of the file. So when you see something crashing, you're like, git blamed? Steve, what the hell were you thinking? Did you even test that? Why would you commit that if it doesn't work?

52
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.890
Marcus M Darden: So, can let you do that.

53
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:14.650
Marcus M Darden: Git versus GitHub, we've talked about using GitHub, but for now, we're just going to be focused on Git. We will be getting some things from GitHub, but our active use on GitHub won't be very strong. We'll do a little bit.

54
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:21.349
Marcus M Darden: Git is the tool on your machine, it's a command line tool. It works really best when you're at a command line.

55
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.080
Marcus M Darden: there is an interface in VS Code, and

56
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:42.430
Marcus M Darden: Xcode, and every editor alive now has a Git interface built into it. And those can be a little bit GUI, so you can sort of mark a file, and then type something in, and it will do the commit for you.

57
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.229
Marcus M Darden: Those things always leave me feeling unsafe. It's not that they don't work, I know that they work perfectly fine.

58
00:09:49.540 --> 00:10:06.130
Marcus M Darden: But, it's like, I have so much control when I'm at the command line, and I'm so used to having so much control that when I sort of have to let somebody else do something, I'm like, did you do exactly what I've done? Or… So, it would probably be best if I learned how to use it more.

59
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:16.309
Marcus M Darden: then I could feel comfortable using it, so if you can develop comfort with it, that's fine. I would still suggest the command line, because when you're in the command line and you're using it.

60
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.939
Marcus M Darden: You know exactly what's happening.

61
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.260
Marcus M Darden: Zach.

62
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.169
Marcus M Darden: So Git is this tool on your machine, it tracks changes.

63
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:44.239
Marcus M Darden: GitHub, and there's also another one, which is an open source version of that. It's called GitLab. We have a GitLab server here on campus, but the GitHub is the commonly used one. GitHub was bought by Microsoft back in 2018, I think. It's the largest source code repository on the planet.

64
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:57.780
Marcus M Darden: Everybody uses it. Everything's in there. You can make your own Git server, I've got a Git server at my house. And what a Git server is, is just like GitHub, without all the web page front end.

65
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.029
Marcus M Darden: So, at its heart.

66
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:08.099
Marcus M Darden: GitHub is just a Git server, so you can say, hey, push my changes to that server.

67
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:19.609
Marcus M Darden: But, in addition to that, it also has a really nice GUI front end, so that you can surf to pages and look at things that you could just as well do at the command line inside of your own repo.

68
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:29.559
Marcus M Darden: But Git makes it… GitHub makes it nice and easy to see. Bitbucket is another one by another company called Atlassian. You'll see that name around if you do any sort of searching in the Git

69
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.150
Marcus M Darden: scheme. So GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, they're all hosted remotes.

70
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:41.790
Marcus M Darden: And you can use Git without any hosting service, which is mostly what we'll be doing here. Mostly just working locally.

71
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:55.830
Marcus M Darden: Git is this distributed version control system, and the distinction between a distributed version control system and a central code repository

72
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:02.099
Marcus M Darden: is in a central code repository. There is literally one source of truth.

73
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.599
Marcus M Darden: When you want to make changes to a file, you have to check that file out, then you make changes, and then you…

74
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:17.019
Marcus M Darden: check that file back in. If you've got a file checked out, nobody else on the team can check that file out.

75
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.619
Marcus M Darden: Because there is one source of truth.

76
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:39.509
Marcus M Darden: In Git, we use this distributed version control system where everyone has their own source of truth, locally. You have all the files, you have all control of all your files, and then what Git has built into it is the ability to say, okay, what happens when I need to join two different sources of truth?

77
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.980
Marcus M Darden: And it just can blow your mind what it does so well.

78
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.020
Marcus M Darden: promise, I've looked at it many times and just thought.

79
00:12:49.160 --> 00:13:06.610
Marcus M Darden: I still don't understand how that works. And I look into it, I'm like, I got a better idea, but I just… in my mind, it's a really huge leap as to just how Git fixes it. And Git works purely with text. You can check binary files, like PDFs.

80
00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:11.020
Marcus M Darden: Or I even have a repo with all of my…

81
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.330
Marcus M Darden: lecture slides for 281 in it, and lecture slides for 281 are

82
00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:30.130
Marcus M Darden: PowerPoint decks, and that's some binary file format that Microsoft uses. So I can check them in there, and what that gives me is the ability to go back and find an old one, but I don't have the ability to see, hey, what changed from here to here?

83
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:40.120
Marcus M Darden: Whereas, if I'm looking at a text file, Git can say, hey, what is the difference between this and that? I say, oh, you added this line, and you subtracted that line, and you added this, and blah blah blah blah blah.

84
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:59.749
Marcus M Darden: That's how Git really likes to work with text, but you can use it with binary files. We typically don't use it for a whole lot, but as I said, I do still need some version control on my slides and say, I would love to get back to what was going on in Fall 25. Let me pull this deck from 25 and see what did I change there. So, it's a little bit less…

85
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:19.999
Marcus M Darden: I use GitLess, I can just pull it out, and so then what I have to do is I have to open one slide set and open another set, and I have to manually go between them to see what the difference is, so I lose some of the cool functionality of Git, but I still re… I still gain the ability to version control and label things, and if you use good commit messages, you can figure out what's done.

86
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:27.600
Marcus M Darden: So, every copy in this distributed version, like I said, has the full version of the truth, it has the full history of everything that's been done.

87
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:36.499
Marcus M Darden: And then when you make changes, and then push back to the central, then… Things get resolved.

88
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.949
Marcus M Darden: It's fast, it works offline, and like I said, it's the industry standard. Everyone's using it.

89
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.670
Marcus M Darden: Here's the mental model.

90
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.800
Marcus M Darden: We've got these 3 locations.

91
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:55.740
Marcus M Darden: There's the working directory. These are where your files are that you're currently editing.

92
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.540
Marcus M Darden: There's a staging area, also known as the index.

93
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.379
Marcus M Darden: And the staging areas, we say, I really like this, I'm gonna keep it.

94
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.240
Marcus M Darden: like this.

95
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.689
Marcus M Darden: And then there's the repository, where you say, have kept this.

96
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:20.459
Marcus M Darden: So your typical workflow is, you are in your working directory, you edit some stuff.

97
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:28.070
Marcus M Darden: And you push it to the staging area, and then you push it from the staging area into the repository.

98
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:35.870
Marcus M Darden: That's your typical workflow, and graphically, it's kind of gonna look like this. You've got your working directory.

99
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.319
Marcus M Darden: And you make edits, Then, when you use git add, it puts files into the staging area.

100
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.790
Marcus M Darden: And then when you use git commit, it writes them permanently into the repository.

101
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:59.839
Marcus M Darden: The cool thing about Git is, once it's committed, it is there. Even if you, like, back up and undo a thing, it keeps what you had there, unless you work hard to delete something that was

102
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:12.430
Marcus M Darden: previously committed. So, that's why it's super safe with Git. If you make a mistake, you can always find your code somewhere. Sometimes it can be harder than others, depending on how far you've wandered away from goodness, but you can usually find it.

103
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:17.440
Marcus M Darden: So, there's kind of our… workflow

104
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.510
Marcus M Darden: And we've got a bunch of commands, and they all are git, Word.

105
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:27.690
Marcus M Darden: Git add, git commit, git status, it's all Git and then another word.

106
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:38.240
Marcus M Darden: And some of the… the challenges of Git is they've got these weird sets of commands that function opposite

107
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:44.989
Marcus M Darden: but don't really fit the good name opposite. So, for instance, there's a command called git bush.

108
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:55.970
Marcus M Darden: You take something from your local repository, push it to a remote repository. There's also a command called git pull. Is it the opposite of git pull… push? No.

109
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.370
Marcus M Darden: The opposite of git push is git fetch.

110
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:05.569
Marcus M Darden: So when you do a git pull, it does a git fetch AND a git merge.

111
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:11.290
Marcus M Darden: So it does some things like that. Another command, git restore.

112
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:21.020
Marcus M Darden: You can use Restore to… restore something from that, but… when I use git add.

113
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.750
Marcus M Darden: See, it takes some changes in my working directory and puts them in the staging area.

114
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.830
Marcus M Darden: If I say get and restore dash dash stage.

115
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:36.510
Marcus M Darden: That's the opposite of git add. But git restore is not the opposite of git add, so…

116
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:52.419
Marcus M Darden: just… you have to be careful, and this is why I said there's so many little quirks about it that I don't feel comfortable letting some tool go do some things if I'm not sure it's using the options that I want to. So, that's why I do my command line Git whenever possible.

117
00:17:53.670 --> 00:18:04.329
Marcus M Darden: So, this is just another version of that, right? We've got our working directory, when we edit files, then we use git add, that puts things in the staging area. We can use git restore stage.

118
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.819
Marcus M Darden: to go back to, it's not in the staging area. It's just a changed file.

119
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:17.440
Marcus M Darden: If I do that, then if I type git commit, there's nothing to commit, because it's not staged. So I edit.

120
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:32.069
Marcus M Darden: add, and then if I'm good with it, I can just say commit. You might wonder, well, why do I have this staging area? If I'm just trying to commit it, why would I have to add it and then commit it? What this allows you to do is, in larger projects, one

121
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.950
Marcus M Darden: commit… Might involve multiple files.

122
00:18:37.430 --> 00:19:01.389
Marcus M Darden: So you say, I've changed this file, and this file, and this file, I'm gonna add all of them to the staging area, or I might change one, add it, change the next one, add it, change the next one, add it, and then commit all of that, because it is the same logical change. So that's why we've got the ability to, use the staging area. And there's just all kind of shortcuts and ways to break the rules, just like any system, there's ways to break the rules.

123
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:08.879
Marcus M Darden: Right? So, if I want to, I can commit a file straight from the working directory, completely bypassing

124
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.120
Marcus M Darden: The staging area. Yep. I can even commit multiple files.

125
00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.029
Marcus M Darden: I have to work a little bit harder at it, but I can do it.

126
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.680
Marcus M Darden: So if you've got something staged, you say, oh no, I really want to commit this first.

127
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:28.660
Marcus M Darden: You can unstage and restage, or you can just kind of, like, loop around it. So that's a more advanced usage, but it's, it's not at all uncommon.

128
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:39.639
Marcus M Darden: So here's the commands that we're gonna learn and use the most for right now. There's git status, and git status, I think…

129
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.959
Marcus M Darden: I use Git Status, Just about every other command.

130
00:19:45.100 --> 00:20:01.689
Marcus M Darden: git status, do a thing. Git status, do a thing. Git status, do a thing. Really nice for a GUI there to tell me things. That would be a reason to use a GUI, but the git status, you just, you're gonna use that a lot. A lot of people even alias that.

131
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:08.530
Marcus M Darden: GS or GST, so that you don't have to type so many characters with a word and space in there. You can do all you like.

132
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.210
Marcus M Darden: Git add, and then we give it some file or files that moves things.

133
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.940
Marcus M Darden: from Bitdeck.

134
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.369
Marcus M Darden: It moves them into the index, into the staging area.

135
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:27.020
Marcus M Darden: And this concept of moving is somewhat…

136
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.840
Marcus M Darden: logical and not physical. So when I've saved a file that's in my working directory.

137
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.349
Marcus M Darden: And then I say, stage it.

138
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:45.589
Marcus M Darden: I say I've moved it from the working directory into the staging area. It actually hasn't moved at all. It's still in the working directory, as you might expect, because it's one of my files.

139
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.990
Marcus M Darden: So, it's there, but it's also…

140
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:58.969
Marcus M Darden: set up at that particular version. So, imagine you did this. You edited something, and you saved it, and then you staged it, and then you edited it some more.

141
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:09.750
Marcus M Darden: So now there is two copies. There's a copy that's in your working directory, and there's a copy that's in the staging area. So if you type commit, you're gonna save the…

142
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:16.610
Marcus M Darden: thing to the repo before your most current edits. So, if you edit.

143
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.930
Marcus M Darden: Add, and then edit again. You can also add again.

144
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:40.380
Marcus M Darden: And it'll just take all of the changes and put them in the staging area. So, you might do that, it might happen from time to time, you'll edit something, you say, okay, I'm ready to commit this, I stage it, oh, I forgot to take that debug print out of there. You go back, take the debug print out, hit add again, and then it just takes the newest version of it. So, that's, not a…

145
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:50.630
Marcus M Darden: So that's git add, and then git commit. So, you're just gonna go add, commit, and later on, when we start using stuff online, you'll do pushes.

146
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.650
Marcus M Darden: There's a…

147
00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:03.170
Marcus M Darden: There's a paper on somebody's door upstairs, I forget which floor it's on. It says, in case of fire, git add, git commit, git push, then run like hell.

148
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:22.049
Marcus M Darden: So, that's how you make sure your code doesn't get lost, but it's that add commit push when we take things remotely, but when we do add commit, that's all we need locally to have all of our history saved for us. We can say git commit, and then if you just leave it like that, it wants to have a message with it.

149
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:31.339
Marcus M Darden: That's why I said earlier, it's like, we can track everything that happens, we know how to blame somebody, so not only do you have to give it your name, your email address.

150
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.040
Marcus M Darden: When you make a commit, it's gonna put your name and email address on that, and it wants to have a message.

151
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.760
Marcus M Darden: So, if you don't give it a message, it will open up an editor and say, I'm waiting for you to give me a message.

152
00:22:43.810 --> 00:23:00.349
Marcus M Darden: Right? If you give it this dash n flag, you can put a short message right there at the command line. Some people say you shouldn't do the short version. I get lazy sometimes. But the more expressive your commit messages are, the more you're able to understand what you did and why.

153
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.920
Marcus M Darden: So, there's git commit, and all of these commands have multiple

154
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:21.069
Marcus M Darden: dash M's or dash dash one lines that you can use to configure how they work, and that's, you know, that's what just comes with using it over and over again. Once you've got a skill, then you say, well, I'd like to tweak that skill just a little bit. Oh, so I really want to do git add minus use, what I really want. You'll understand that later.

155
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:26.980
Marcus M Darden: Once I've added and committed, when I want to see what history looks like.

156
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.559
Marcus M Darden: I just use git log most of the time.

157
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:37.020
Marcus M Darden: As we're working on these slides, we came up with git log one line, and I'll show you the difference between the two of those things.

158
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:45.329
Marcus M Darden: There's a bunch of different ways that you can configure the log command to print things out the way you want to see what's going on in history.

159
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:50.680
Marcus M Darden: Undo staging, as I mentioned earlier. Git restore dash dash staged file.

160
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.259
Marcus M Darden: Now, what happens if you don't use dash dash staged?

161
00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.780
Marcus M Darden: Danger.

162
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:14.480
Marcus M Darden: That's what's so terrible. We use git restore dash dash stage to save us, but git restore might just kill us. So, what restore does, it says, I'm gonna grab from the repo and overwrite what's in the working directory.

163
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:20.580
Marcus M Darden: So if you've made some changes, and then you type git restore, all your changes are gone, permanently, they're gone.

164
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:21.830
Marcus M Darden: Just gone.

165
00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:28.209
Marcus M Darden: Nothing is permanent until you commit it. So, git restore without the dash dash staged.

166
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:36.789
Marcus M Darden: can blow things up. What stash-stage does says, it's still gonna overwrite what's in your working directory, so if you do an edit.

167
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.270
Marcus M Darden: Add… arrogant.

168
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.710
Marcus M Darden: Restore staged, You're gonna blow those changes away.

169
00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:52.610
Marcus M Darden: If you do an edit, save, and then you do a restore, you're gonna blow those changes away from the repo.

170
00:24:52.940 --> 00:25:09.699
Marcus M Darden: When you do the dash dash staged, it pulls it away from what's staged. When you do no staged, it pulls it away from the repo. So both of them are really going to overwrite what's in your working directory, no matter what. It's just typically, when you're doing from staged, you're meaning a different thing than when you do it without from staged.

171
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.240
Marcus M Darden: You can do git restore stage, and all of these things that say file after them, you can save more files if you need to.

172
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:27.580
Marcus M Darden: And then when you want to discard local edits, right there, it says git restore, so that's going to say anything that I've already worked on in my working directory, I'm just throwing it away. So that's what git restore will do.

173
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:37.450
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so to get this thing installed, here's a few different ways to do it. You can use Git Bash if you're a Windows user.

174
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:49.190
Marcus M Darden: And Git Bash is a Windows program that also includes a terminal so that you can do command line Git. But it's a regular program, so it's not just a terminal.

175
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:58.290
Marcus M Darden: Macos, you just jump into the terminal. I don't use Terminal App on my Mac OS. I've installed another app that's called iTerm2.

176
00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:06.370
Marcus M Darden: It's a similar program that's just got some more functionality. But if you use Terminal, alright, you'll see me using our term too, so it might not look exactly like yours.

177
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:17.480
Marcus M Darden: That's kind of what my I-term2 looks like if I say terminal, Looked like that.

178
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:24.249
Marcus M Darden: Just because that's how that one's… I could configure this one to look a bit more like that, but I just don't use this one as much.

179
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.460
Marcus M Darden: So…

180
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:43.389
Marcus M Darden: Anything that does give you terminal access on a Mac, though, is gonna be fine. And Git will be installed. If it's not, you might have to install it. If you've installed any development tools, Git will be on there. But if you haven't, then if you do a Brew install Git. If you don't have Brew, you might check out Homebrew.

181
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:57.619
Marcus M Darden: Homebrew is a package manager that lets you install stuff, so look up Homebrew, and use brew install git if you need to. On Linux, the same sort of thing. This is the WSL, if you're using WSL, on your Windows boxes.

182
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.829
Marcus M Darden: That lets you run a little…

183
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:11.269
Marcus M Darden: Linux kernel as you're running Ubuntu inside of Windows. So if you do that, then you might have to do act install git, or DNF install git. One of those two commands will install

184
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.110
Marcus M Darden: get for you.

185
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.020
Marcus M Darden: on the Linux side.

186
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:31.240
Marcus M Darden: Once that's done, you should be able to type git dash dash version, and it will respond that it knows about the thing, right? Git dash dash version. You don't really care what that is, but if that doesn't respond well, that just means git is not installed.

187
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:38.940
Marcus M Darden: So here I can see that I've got this Git version 2.50.1, and that's the one that was installed by Apple. I didn't install a separate one.

188
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:39.970
Marcus M Darden: I think.

189
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.879
Marcus M Darden: I don't even remember But it works.

190
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.020
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

191
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:59.879
Marcus M Darden: After we've got it installed, you're gonna have to set your identity. Remember I told you earlier, it wants to know who does a thing, so when you commit, it's going to put your name and email address on it, so somebody can complain to you when you've broken things.

192
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:08.049
Marcus M Darden: So, if you try to commit before it does that, it will put some anonymous stuff on there and continue to nag at you. Git is very, very talkative.

193
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:17.890
Marcus M Darden: When it doesn't like a thing, it'll tell you. When it thinks you should be doing something else, it will say, did you mean to do this? If you want to do that, try this. It's very, very, very, very talkative.

194
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:30.119
Marcus M Darden: But, if you try to commit before you've added your username in there, then it will complain and say, you know, it will say that it was an anonymous thing. So, you'll just have to do this once.

195
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:42.100
Marcus M Darden: You say git config, and then add this global flag, which adds this to the overall… every repo is gonna think of you as Hayden Lovelace.

196
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.300
Marcus M Darden: Right?

197
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:50.080
Marcus M Darden: So you can do git config local, and that will make configuration changes to the current repo.

198
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.379
Marcus M Darden: And the current repo changes override the

199
00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:02.160
Marcus M Darden: the global ones. So, why would you do something like that? Maybe I've got some job that I work at.

200
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:16.609
Marcus M Darden: And I want to use my… the name that they call me at that job, and my email from that job. So, inside of that repo, I say my local configuration for this repo has my work email address and work title.

201
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.979
Marcus M Darden: But when I work on my own projects at home.

202
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:33.320
Marcus M Darden: I want to use my own email address, because I don't want people emailing my job to talk about why did I do this on GitHub. So, you might set your global to be the UU, personal U, and then you might, whenever you've got some

203
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:43.799
Marcus M Darden: repo, you might jump into that and say, I'm going to set some local configs so that I can override that. So, like I said, the local overrides the goal.

204
00:29:44.480 --> 00:30:02.940
Marcus M Darden: So, once you do this, you should be fine, unless you're trying to, like I said, work in multiple contexts. Just setting the config to, update your username and email is fine. You do have to have the quotes if there's a space there. You don't have to use the quotes in the email example there.

205
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:13.859
Marcus M Darden: Just because there's no spaces. It just knows how to pull a token. So, if it's got quotes, then it says, okay, the token is between these two quotes, so if there's spaces involved, I would use that as well.

206
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.499
Marcus M Darden: And then there's some optional stuff, the quality of life stuff.

207
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.119
Marcus M Darden: The core editor.

208
00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:29.120
Marcus M Darden: Here, and the command that you use to spin off the coordinator is just code.

209
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.469
Marcus M Darden: Dash, dash, wait. So code is VS Code.

210
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.820
Marcus M Darden: whatever machine you're on, if you've got VS Code installed, the way that you can start it from the command line is just say code.

211
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:53.029
Marcus M Darden: And if you give it this wait flag, then the program that's kicking off the editor waits until you close the editor to move forward. So this is important, like, when you want to do a commit.

212
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.409
Marcus M Darden: Says, okay, well, I need a message.

213
00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:05.019
Marcus M Darden: it opens up a VS Code window, you make some edits, and when you're done, you close the window, and then the commit can continue. But until you close the window, it's waiting.

214
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:13.800
Marcus M Darden: And then the other one down here, this git config global init default branch main. So…

215
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.189
Marcus M Darden: You know, we are in a…

216
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:24.299
Marcus M Darden: A modern changing of the way we do things, and talk about things, and deal with people, and all of that stuff.

217
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.109
Marcus M Darden: The original version of… Get used to call the main branch.

218
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.750
Marcus M Darden: Sorry, I used to call the default branch.

219
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.050
Marcus M Darden: Master.

220
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.969
Marcus M Darden: As in… Master and slave!

221
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.750
Marcus M Darden: And so… People said we shouldn't use that type of language.

222
00:31:44.270 --> 00:32:00.129
Marcus M Darden: And then, just over the last couple of years, most of the gits now automatically go with main, but if you ever look in some older repos, you might find branches called master. Master was the default in the past. When you created a new repo, you were already on the master branch.

223
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:07.740
Marcus M Darden: So… however you feel about, DEI and things like that.

224
00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:14.509
Marcus M Darden: This is where you can change that. If you really want to go with master, you can change it with that line. If you want to call it

225
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:34.169
Marcus M Darden: my branch, this is where you change it. So when you create a new repo, it defaults to that branch. So these things you only have to do once because it writes them into a permanent file, and then every time you use Git after that, it edits that… references that file. You can edit and change them if you like.

226
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.750
Marcus M Darden: But… You don't have to once you've done it once.

227
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:43.950
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, here's what we're gonna do. We're going to create a repo.

228
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:49.129
Marcus M Darden: And typically, repos are all in their own directory.

229
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:56.350
Marcus M Darden: So from the command line, what I would do is create a directory with maker, and then I would change into that directory.

230
00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:06.100
Marcus M Darden: Now that I'm there, I can do my very first git command, which is git init. Git init turns this directory into a repo.

231
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.409
Marcus M Darden: It creates this hidden folder.

232
00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:23.410
Marcus M Darden: in that directory, and in the Unix tradition, any file that begins with a period, we call them dot files, and they're there, but if you ask for the listing of this directory, it just hides those.

233
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:38.549
Marcus M Darden: You can say, I want to see the hidden files. LS shows me all the files, except the hidden ones. LS-A shows me all the hidden ones. So, if I'm here, what did I say we were going to do?

234
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.670
Marcus M Darden: Let me get to… where I've kept this.

235
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.950
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so if I come here and I say,

236
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.789
Marcus M Darden: Gonna go out there, that's better.

237
00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.929
Marcus M Darden: Let's make Durr, and… Not you.

238
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.530
Marcus M Darden: Victor, I said, demo, get.

239
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.089
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so by doing LS, you'll see I just created this directory.

240
00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:14.290
Marcus M Darden: And you see that I don't see anything other than things that are there. There might be some hidden files. If I see LS minus A,

241
00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:30.749
Marcus M Darden: You'll see there are two other files in that directory, one that's called dot, and another one's called dot dot. And those are just shortcuts in the Unix tradition. Dot means the current directory, and dot dot means the parent directory, whatever I got out of to get into here.

242
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:39.269
Marcus M Darden: So… I'm gonna CD into demo Git, And type git init.

243
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:57.659
Marcus M Darden: There you go. It says, initialized an empty Git repository, and it tells me where it stuck that thing. Turns out it's in this folder, but in a hidden folder there.git. So I'll do the same sort of thing. You see, I created that directory, jumped in there, it's still dead empty.

244
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.120
Marcus M Darden: Because I didn't do anything with any files. But if I type ls minus A,

245
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:11.809
Marcus M Darden: you'll see that there is a .git directory in there, and that's a full directory, so if I want to, I can do ls git, and it tells me there's a whole bunch of stuff in there.

246
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:20.919
Marcus M Darden: There's a config, that's a file where all of your local configs go. You don't need to know this stuff.

247
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:32.770
Marcus M Darden: But if you want to, you can just edit stuff there by hand, or you can use the git config command. The other things are how Git is the database that how Git stores all of your changes.

248
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:43.020
Marcus M Darden: in objects, and refs, and description, hooks. Hooks is where you can put stuff to say, when I do this, before that happens, call some function.

249
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:59.720
Marcus M Darden: or do something. Run this script after I get done, so that it automatically labels something or whatever. So hooks are a way that you can do some automation, but we won't mess with that either. This is not a Git class. But, as you see, I've created this repo, and I have everything that I need.

250
00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:06.770
Marcus M Darden: The folder is my history database, the rest of my files are normal files, which in this case is exactly none, because it's empty.

251
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.049
Marcus M Darden: So let's add a README.

252
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.040
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna create a file and check its status. So, here, I'm just gonna use the echo command, and the echo command…

253
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:21.650
Marcus M Darden: Takes, and whatever you give it, that echoes it.

254
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.609
Marcus M Darden: Pretty straightforward. It does what it says.

255
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:36.020
Marcus M Darden: Then, that greater than sign is known as file redirection. It says, rather than having that echo to the screen, dump it into a file named readme.md.

256
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.940
Marcus M Darden: So, I'll try that, and just see what it looks like. I say echo, Demo Git.

257
00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:45.570
Marcus M Darden: There you go. It echoed it.

258
00:36:46.550 --> 00:37:02.949
Marcus M Darden: Right? I said echo demo git, it turned around and printed it for me. So, by doing LS, there's no files created, because I told it to do a command, it did the command. Now, if I want to, I can say, echo that, but instead of printing to the screen, put it into the README.

259
00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.739
Marcus M Darden: Now you'll see it doesn't go to the screen at all.

260
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:13.829
Marcus M Darden: Because the output was redirected into a file named readme.md. The file didn't exist.

261
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.090
Marcus M Darden: Linux don't care.

262
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:26.729
Marcus M Darden: the file doesn't exist, and you say, stick some stuff in a file, it's gonna create the file. So now, if I type ls, you'll see there is a readme.md here.

263
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.320
Marcus M Darden: And if I want to see what's in that, I can use CAT.

264
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:40.140
Marcus M Darden: it'll tell me what's in there. It's got that same line that I told it to print, but inside the file, if I want to edit the file, I can do code.

265
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.730
Marcus M Darden: this directory.

266
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:55.980
Marcus M Darden: Right? Yes, I trust the authors, that's me. But here's this readme.md file, and just like you saw me edit it, I edited at the command line, and it's got that demo get in there. If I wanted to change the file now, I could.

267
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.030
Marcus M Darden: But for now, I'm not going to.

268
00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.440
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

269
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.569
Marcus M Darden: So far, so good?

270
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.970
Marcus M Darden: Excellent.

271
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:12.179
Marcus M Darden: So, we were supposed to check our status, though, we did not. So, let's say get status.

272
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:26.550
Marcus M Darden: It says, I'm on branch main, very important, you need to know where you're making changes. So the first thing it always tells you is, where are you in the project? We'll talk about branches later, not today.

273
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:41.150
Marcus M Darden: But branches is a cool way to be like, hey, this works exactly like I want it to, but I want to try this crazy-ass stuff over here. So let me branch off, and I get to hacking away on it, and if it's broken, and I just say, okay, switch back to that other branch, and I'm good.

274
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.020
Marcus M Darden: Right? Later on, you can say, well, I got this crazy thing to work.

275
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.430
Marcus M Darden: Now what I want to do is I'm going to jump back to the main branch.

276
00:38:49.730 --> 00:39:05.570
Marcus M Darden: and merge those changes from the crazy-ass branch back into the current branch. And that way, I can incorporate them, and they will be working. So it allows you to keep two versions, like the working version and the experimental version, and any number of experimental versions.

277
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:13.700
Marcus M Darden: You have feature branches, where you say, I'm gonna add this new feature, I need to be able to read this kind of file. I got a feature branch to do that. Once I'm done, I go to the main branch.

278
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:26.659
Marcus M Darden: And then I merge those changes back in, and the main branch can now read those types of files. If I got multiple features where I'm opening this type of file and writing to that type of file, those are two different features. You probably don't want to work on them at the same time.

279
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.739
Marcus M Darden: You probably shouldn't, especially if you're working in a larger…

280
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:35.780
Marcus M Darden: larger sphere where there's other people. Somebody's working on part of this over here, you're working on part of it over there, so stay in your lane.

281
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.749
Marcus M Darden: So, here we say that I'm on branch main, it says there have been no commits.

282
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:59.369
Marcus M Darden: there are untracked files, and it's called readme.md. So an untracked file is a file that's in the working directory, but Git doesn't know about. Git can see it, obviously, it's told me it's right there, but it's not in the repo. It's just in the folder where the repo lives.

283
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:03.530
Marcus M Darden: So this is something that's an example of readme.md.

284
00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:17.050
Marcus M Darden: lives in the working directory. It has not been through the staging area, it has not been added to the repository. So it's only in the working directory. It says nothing has been added to commit.

285
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:24.289
Marcus M Darden: But, untracked files are present. If you want to track it, use git add. What'd I tell you?

286
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:42.040
Marcus M Darden: Even before that, it's like, untracked files, use git add. This is how you can include it in what will be committed. So, I think that was our next slide, so let's truck back over there. So, we checked out status, and there's also, SB. Let's try that one. Status…

287
00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.809
Marcus M Darden: Git status.

288
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.470
Marcus M Darden: That's beef.

289
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:56.010
Marcus M Darden: So, you see, This is a shorter version of it. It tells me no commits yet.

290
00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:02.590
Marcus M Darden: It tells me I'm on main, and then it gives me a listing of all the files and their current state. There's only one file.

291
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.890
Marcus M Darden: And it's README, so it's at this state where it's question mark, question mark.

292
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:09.420
Marcus M Darden: So, it's untracked.

293
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.070
Marcus M Darden: But once I have stuff in there, it will tell me if something is

294
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:28.829
Marcus M Darden: in the repo, it will tell me if something has been modified in need of a commit, or if something is untracked, and we'll see that as we work forward. So, Git Status SB is a shorter version of it, and you can sort of get some real

295
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:32.709
Marcus M Darden: Quick glances, especially in larger file sets.

296
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.790
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

297
00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:41.249
Marcus M Darden: Untracked means Git sees it, but is not tracking it yet, so Git can't remember it if you don't commit it.

298
00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.209
Marcus M Darden: It can see it, but it's not gonna do anything for you.

299
00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.370
Marcus M Darden: So now we're gonna add some notes.

300
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.249
Marcus M Darden: Do we not commit that? We did not commit that, do we?

301
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.159
Marcus M Darden: Let's add some notes.

302
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.389
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna use this echo command again.

303
00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.770
Marcus M Darden: And I'm just gonna echo hello into this notes file. Same sort of thing.

304
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:06.850
Marcus M Darden: Echo, hello, and dump that into a new file named notes.txt.

305
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.600
Marcus M Darden: One thing to be very…

306
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:16.390
Marcus M Darden: clear on when I use that file redirection, that greater than, it takes the output and dumps it into a file.

307
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:23.039
Marcus M Darden: If that file already exists, it takes that output and dumps it into the file, completely overriding what was there.

308
00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:30.160
Marcus M Darden: So, just be careful when you're using that. If you don't want to blow stuff away, then you can say…

309
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:38.630
Marcus M Darden: Echo… World… But… appendedToNotes.txt.

310
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.580
Marcus M Darden: So now there's echo on one line, there's hello on one line, and World on the next.

311
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:52.990
Marcus M Darden: Right? And you can see that if I just type cat, notes concatenated to the screen. Now, you see if I say echo hello.

312
00:42:54.630 --> 00:43:01.270
Marcus M Darden: and put that into notes.txt, I've flown away what I had before, so the only thing that's in there is hello.

313
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.530
Marcus M Darden: So, that's how file redirection works. We've got

314
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.749
Marcus M Darden: Write to file, we've got append to file.

315
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.659
Marcus M Darden: Greater, and double greater.

316
00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:16.480
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so, now I've got this notes file, and they also warned us that we should type a git status

317
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:24.149
Marcus M Darden: If I look at it like this, there's the long version, get status, SB… Books like that.

318
00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:37.810
Marcus M Darden: So, now I know the same things from both of these things. I've got these two untracked files, one named readme.md, one named notes.txt. So, any changes in those files are obviously not in the repo if they are not being tracked.

319
00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:45.240
Marcus M Darden: So, I think the next thing that we're gonna do here is try to make something go out of that. So, okay, we did this. We saw the notes when we did status.

320
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:49.350
Marcus M Darden: Now, let's figure out how we're gonna stage some stuff.

321
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:53.120
Marcus M Darden: Git add is how we move things from

322
00:43:53.960 --> 00:44:00.630
Marcus M Darden: the working directory into the staging area. So I'm just gonna add gitNotes.txt and then check my status.

323
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.649
Marcus M Darden: Add notes.

324
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:21.780
Marcus M Darden: No response. Most of our Unix commands, when they execute properly, they don't say a thing. So, you can assume here that nothing was error messaged. That probably worked. I can use git status to check it out. We see now it looks a little different. Let me clean up and try that again. OnMay, no commits.

325
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:30.180
Marcus M Darden: Now it tells me the changes that are going to be committed, that's new file, it's a new file, it's called notes.txt.

326
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:38.859
Marcus M Darden: And then there's still untracked files, that's readb.md. There's also some extra helpful stuff in there that says, hey, if you want to unstage this.

327
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:43.499
Marcus M Darden: I can do a git rm dash dash cached.

328
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.190
Marcus M Darden: File to unstage it.

329
00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.510
Marcus M Darden: how that's different from git restore dash dash stage.

330
00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:59.830
Marcus M Darden: I don't know. It might only work of the thing… I don't know. I don't… that's what gets us, for now.

331
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:10.589
Marcus M Darden: Git add file will… okay, so there we go. So, I've got that ready, and what did I say I was gonna do? Check the status. I did. If I wanted to check the short version of status.

332
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.829
Marcus M Darden: There you go. So you can see how the short version kind of works there.

333
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.880
Marcus M Darden: A has been added, it's in the staging area.

334
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.459
Marcus M Darden: Sorry, notes has been added, it's in the staging area, README has not.

335
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.690
Marcus M Darden: We're going to… we did check that, yeah, that's good.

336
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:42.159
Marcus M Darden: Capture a clean snapshot. There we go. Let's do a git commit minus m add node files.

337
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:49.120
Marcus M Darden: Git commit, I'm gonna give it the message, And… Notes file.

338
00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.989
Marcus M Darden: And there we see, we get this message back.

339
00:45:53.990 --> 00:46:18.229
Marcus M Darden: And I get my message, it tells me I'm on the main, I got my root commit, and then we have this hash here, and it's much longer than this, it's about 30 characters long, but any version of it that you use that's unique, Git will be fine with. So, I could probably just refer to this as A9, because there's no other commits. But later on, I might have a commit that also starts with A9, so you have to have enough of this to be unique.

340
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:25.679
Marcus M Darden: And usually, 6 to 7 characters is really good. So, later on, you might use Git IDs like that.

341
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:37.509
Marcus M Darden: And so there's message adds notes file. One file changed, there was one insertion, there was one line that I changed in that file, and the create mode, this thing tells me about that file. Now, if I do a git status.

342
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.049
Marcus M Darden: It looks like that.

343
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:43.659
Marcus M Darden: The thing that's been added to the repo is just gone now.

344
00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:59.340
Marcus M Darden: At least from status, because it says, okay, you put it in the repo, it's good. You don't have to worry about it. The only thing you really need to worry about is what's going on. What does it tell me now? It tells me I'm on branch main, it doesn't say that I have no commits yet. It does say…

345
00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:07.130
Marcus M Darden: untracked files exist, but nothing has been added, so if I try to do a commit, it won't do anything. So what happens when I SB this?

346
00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.379
Marcus M Darden: There you go.

347
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.820
Marcus M Darden: tells me I'm on Branch, Maine.

348
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.980
Marcus M Darden: And it tells me that I just don't know about README.

349
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.870
Marcus M Darden: Anything else that I already put on there?

350
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.030
Marcus M Darden: is good.

351
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.369
Marcus M Darden: There's some pretty particular ways you're supposed to make your GIF messages.

352
00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.999
Marcus M Darden: You're supposed to use descriptive verbs, like I did here. It said, add notes file.

353
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.120
Marcus M Darden: And so…

354
00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:55.039
Marcus M Darden: The convention for git commit messages is to have this declarative statement, and you see here, you should think of that statement as being able to be read as, accepting this commit will…

355
00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.870
Marcus M Darden: your message.

356
00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:02.509
Marcus M Darden: So your message shouldn't be, I deleted so-and-so.

357
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:21.670
Marcus M Darden: Right? Because then that would read like, accepting this commit, well, I deleted so-and-so. That doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So if you said, delete so-and-so as the message, then it would read as, accepting this commit will delete so-and-so. So you can think that when you've got some systems in place, you start doing automation.

358
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:32.820
Marcus M Darden: That line is, like, the subject of an email, and so systems will kick that off as a subject of an email, and then you can put a body in there as well, and that will be put into the body.

359
00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:43.569
Marcus M Darden: We'll show that when we get to it, but for now, we're good. So, you want to have one change per commit when possible, like, I only fixed this bug. I don't want to fix 10 bugs in one commit, I want to fix…

360
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:59.889
Marcus M Darden: 10 bugs and 10 commits. Super easy. Commits don't cost anything. You just say, git add, git commit, git add, git commit. So, try to do that, because then when you make a bunch of changes in one situation, and you want to undo part of that, it's much more challenging.

361
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:14.760
Marcus M Darden: Make a bunch of changes, and each one lives in their own commit, and you want to undo part of it, you want to reorder it, Git will let you take some changes and reorder the changes. First I did this, and then I did that, and then I did the other thing, but wait, I should have done the other thing first, and then that, and then this.

362
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:21.919
Marcus M Darden: You can have Git do that, but only if you say this, that, and the other thing are three separate commits.

363
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.180
Marcus M Darden: All right.

364
00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:32.290
Marcus M Darden: So, let's put some more notes in there, check the status, add and commit some more notes.

365
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:46.329
Marcus M Darden: So, I'm gonna do just that. Notice the double greater right here, because I do want to append to notes, I don't want to overwrite my notes. So, say, echo, new line, more notes.

366
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:49.080
Marcus M Darden: And dump that into notes.

367
00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.040
Marcus M Darden: Git add… Oops.

368
00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:11.579
Marcus M Darden: Oh, I just edited it, but you see it? Git status, there we go. So now, I added it. So, here we go, I added it, but my demo didn't add it, so I can undo that. So I can say, git restore dash dash staged

369
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:20.969
Marcus M Darden: notes.txt, so… Right now, my working directory copy is the same as my staged copy.

370
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:38.970
Marcus M Darden: So when I do this restore, it's gonna override my working directory copy with the stage copy, which makes no difference. But it also removes it from the staging area, so then I can't commit it unless I do another add. So here I've done it, now if I check a git status, you'll see that it has been modified

371
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.879
Marcus M Darden: But it is not staged for commit. Change is not staged for commit.

372
00:50:47.120 --> 00:51:00.379
Marcus M Darden: And if I want to, I have to get add file, git restore file. Like I said, Git is super great about saying, hey, this is what you probably want to do, you want to do some stuff like this? Here's the command, git add file, git restore file. Great, because, you know why? Notes has been modified.

373
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:12.639
Marcus M Darden: There's the version that's in the repo, and then there's the version that's in my working directory, and they are different. If you like those changes, you should keep them by doing a git add, git restore. The untracked file, which is README, still lives out there, we'll deal with that.

374
00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:20.039
Marcus M Darden: Right about now. So, I can say that's not staged for commit. What if I want to add the README, get add readme.

375
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:25.390
Marcus M Darden: Git commit minus M, add README to repo.

376
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:29.659
Marcus M Darden: I do a git status.

377
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:40.249
Marcus M Darden: And you see, I still have this modified notes, and I haven't made a change yet. So, I'm gonna go there and update that, say, get

378
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:48.179
Marcus M Darden: And here's where I said you could sort of go around the staging area. I'll show you the goods right now. Git commit minus M,

379
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.030
Marcus M Darden: Add more notes.

380
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:58.189
Marcus M Darden: And if I do that, it's gonna be like, you haven't added anything to the staging area, so I can't do that for you.

381
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:10.520
Marcus M Darden: It did nothing. You can tell that it did nothing, because it told me stuff. If it had done something, it wouldn't have said anything. So, if I really want to do that by avoiding the staging area, I can just add notes.txt to this line.

382
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:19.090
Marcus M Darden: But only if notes.txt is already in the repo. If it's untracked, I can't do it. If it's untracked, I have to do add.

383
00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:32.240
Marcus M Darden: So this is what I was saying earlier, is you could go straight from changes in the working directory into the repo if I say git commit minus m with the message, and then, boom, those files. Then it puts them straight from the working directory.

384
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.680
Marcus M Darden: into the rebuild

385
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:44.970
Marcus M Darden: The staging area, remember, we move things into the staging area with add, but what I didn't say is, when you do a commit, it moves the stuff from the staging area into the repo.

386
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.299
Marcus M Darden: Thus, clearing your staging area.

387
00:52:47.520 --> 00:53:11.880
Marcus M Darden: So this one just jumped past the staging area, but it's like I had it before, the staging area was empty. Now it says, add more notes, one file's changed, there were two insertions, there was a blank line, and a more notes line. So, if I do a git status at this point, like, hey, you're on Brant's main, there's nothing to commit, your working tree is clean, because every file that's in my working directory is an exact match to the name of the file that's in the repo.

388
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.030
Marcus M Darden: That's what they call a clean working directory.

389
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.939
Marcus M Darden: So… There we are.

390
00:53:20.820 --> 00:53:22.929
Marcus M Darden: Add more notes, we've committed that.

391
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:31.160
Marcus M Darden: Let's check out what changed. So, git log is how you do that. If I can come here and say git log.

392
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:38.529
Marcus M Darden: And there you see all of the commits that I've done, and it goes in reverse order, so the one at the top is the most recent.

393
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:50.860
Marcus M Darden: That's when I added more notes. And you see the full hash up there. Looks like B30, V1EE2BD, blah blah blah blah blah. But, it's very unique.

394
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:55.310
Marcus M Darden: Because it looks at every character in that change.

395
00:53:55.510 --> 00:54:11.160
Marcus M Darden: And it does that hash on all of that thing, and so you can't make this commit again unless you have exactly the exact same directory context. It looks at every file that it knows about, and hashes it into a single number, and that is the number.

396
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.030
Marcus M Darden: So, this is how we know that they're unique.

397
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:30.630
Marcus M Darden: Well, you see, I started by adding a notes file, then I added the README to the repo, and then I said, add more notes. But this is all of what's going on, what the history of this repo is. And we can also do this with a one-line version.

398
00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:38.889
Marcus M Darden: And as you might imagine, it's just a briefer version of it. So get one line just gives me the short version of those hashes.

399
00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.390
Marcus M Darden: And…

400
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:47.939
Marcus M Darden: It tells me about them. It also tells me where I am, that's what that head main thing is.

401
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:54.130
Marcus M Darden: Head is my current version of the repo that I'm working on, so if I want to go back in time.

402
00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.790
Marcus M Darden: I can't.

403
00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:04.550
Marcus M Darden: So, I say, get checked out, Head.

404
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:06.960
Marcus M Darden: But I'm gonna move back one commit.

405
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:18.799
Marcus M Darden: I'm in a detached head state, there's a bunch of warnings there. But now, I'm one commit back, so if I do an LS,

406
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:30.130
Marcus M Darden: I'll see notes and read me, but what's in them? Remember, I added more notes with the most recent commit, but now I've just undone that, so if I say cat notes.

407
00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:33.429
Marcus M Darden: You see, it's still just the one-line version of that.

408
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:42.550
Marcus M Darden: If I say git checkout main, that puts me back in there, head, sorry. Git checkout head, now if I do cat notes.

409
00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:44.750
Marcus M Darden: What?

410
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.650
Marcus M Darden: Yep.

411
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.450
Marcus M Darden: Check out Maine, that's what I really want to do. There we go.

412
00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:00.320
Marcus M Darden: Previous head position was there, head is where it is. Okay, so now when I do that, you can see that my…

413
00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:04.270
Marcus M Darden: Nodes file has two nodes in it.

414
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:12.650
Marcus M Darden: So, I kind of flubbed that one, so let me try it again. So, here's how I can go back in time. Say, git checkout.

415
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.489
Marcus M Darden: If I want to, I could say, git log one line.

416
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:26.850
Marcus M Darden: And I want to move back to before I added more notes. So I can say git checkout… 4B4FDD4.

417
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:34.029
Marcus M Darden: It says, hey, now I'm switched to that one, and if I do a… Pat of Notes.

418
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:49.660
Marcus M Darden: There's just hello in there. So I have gone back in time. I am in my working directory when that thing happened. If I want to get to where the current thing is, I still need to get back up to main, so I can just say git checkout main.

419
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:54.609
Marcus M Darden: And now, if I say, well, no, show me what's in the file now, you see that there's two lines, and so…

420
00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:11.209
Marcus M Darden: Git is editing this file for me, taking me back in time, and it's not just this file, it's every file in the directory. So you can say, hey, I'd like to jump back to this project 2 years ago, and you might not even recognize the directory structure, because so many things have been changed and added and moved in and out, but

421
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:26.830
Marcus M Darden: all of that history is there, and Git can instantly jump you to any point that you've ever saved. Every single commit can be revisited, and you can live from there, you can jump off from there, you can edit, you can return yourself back to, okay, I just want to skip all of those new changes.

422
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:33.669
Marcus M Darden: Make this be the new current, you can do all kinds of things. So, there we go. We have gotten through…

423
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:42.249
Marcus M Darden: log, that's what it looks like. You can do some more stuff here, one line and graph decorate, so get…

424
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:47.550
Marcus M Darden: Log… one line, Show me a graph.

425
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:49.370
Marcus M Darden: decorated.

426
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:56.400
Marcus M Darden: Doesn't look a whole lot different, it's got just these little… Asterisks over there.

427
00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:01.159
Marcus M Darden: was. When you get a big project, and you start having branches.

428
00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:15.179
Marcus M Darden: this will expand to show the different paths that exist in your code, however much it needs to. So, since it doesn't really expand, it doesn't expand much. So, for now, that's just a future pipe dream.

429
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.280
Marcus M Darden: Alright?

430
00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:23.930
Marcus M Darden: Alright, safe undo. I talked about restore stage, this unstaged file, keeping your edits.

431
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:29.830
Marcus M Darden: Because you made edits, and then you staged them. If you unstaged them, you keep the edits.

432
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:42.730
Marcus M Darden: To discard an edit, and it says be careful there, just use restore without staged. Super dangerous, but that's how it is. You make mistakes.

433
00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:56.879
Marcus M Darden: You can still use the recover from them, other than when you blow out code that you haven't committed yet, you can't recover from that. You just have to rewrite it. So, git restore will overwrite that notes from what's in the repo, not what's in the staging area.

434
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:03.070
Marcus M Darden: So we do want to avoid destructive history rewrites.

435
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:19.010
Marcus M Darden: So, somebody tells you to do a git reset hard, that should already sound a little dangerous, and it is. So, this takes us back in history and makes it impossible to move forward in history. So, if you do a git reset hard, you will lose forward work.

436
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:33.220
Marcus M Darden: And it is pretty comfortable, but it's a lot more painful. So, it's out there. Git push, that's when we're using remotes. You can overwrite some changes on a remote, even if you shouldn't. That's what that does.

437
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:37.940
Marcus M Darden: The last thing I think we're gonna tack on here is this gitignore file.

438
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:57.520
Marcus M Darden: So, we'll have some junk in our directories, especially on macOS. They like to put some little dot files in there, especially, you see this ipyNB checkpoints that maybe you've found that file in your directory. When you do a save while you're in a Python notebook, it puts a checkpoint into this file, into this folder.

439
00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.790
Marcus M Darden: He said, okay, well, I don't want to commit those.

440
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:12.060
Marcus M Darden: How do I know to not commit them? Because every time I say status, it's like, hey, you changed something in this checkpoint. Like, I don't care, I never want to commit checkpoints. So there's a file named

441
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:17.940
Marcus M Darden: gitignore, hidden file again, and anything in there, it says we're not going to…

442
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:26.009
Marcus M Darden: even try to do that. Once we start running Python files, we'll get this PyCache directory, stuff gets written in there, the data's…

443
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:38.630
Marcus M Darden: store that macOS uses kind of gets written there from time to time, too. So you just kind of keep the junk out of there by putting it into a gitignore file. So, for instance, let me say I've got some

444
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:47.600
Marcus M Darden: This is my source code file. So I've got this, and maybe I do some work and this program runs, and it shoots out a file

445
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.220
Marcus M Darden: Called output.txt.

446
01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:03.499
Marcus M Darden: It's very a poor form to put outputs into your repo, just because your repo is usually source code that can generate the outputs.

447
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:26.990
Marcus M Darden: So it's a waste of time. So, if I have it like this, now I do an LS, you see there's output, notes, and readme. If I do a git status, it's going to be like, hey, I haven't tracked this output.txt file. Do you want to put it in there? Do you want to put it in there? It's going to keep asking, do you want to put it in there till the end of time, because it sees something new and it wants to deal with it. So, you know what? I never want to do that, so I'm going to go ahead and echo that file name, output.txt.

448
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:30.500
Marcus M Darden: And I'm gonna dump it into another file called gitignore.

449
01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:37.659
Marcus M Darden: What that does is it just tells git, ignore any file with that name. Now, when I type git status.

450
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:41.970
Marcus M Darden: Like, I don't care about your output.

451
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:55.730
Marcus M Darden: I do care about gitignore, it's still just a file, so Git wants to know about that, too. But typically, when you do this, you're meaning to do it on purpose, so I'll make those changes, then I'll say git add.giddy, and I'll say git add, sorry, commit.

452
01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:06.539
Marcus M Darden: If I just hit git commit, it opens me up in a text editor, because it says, hey, you need a message there, so I'm going to add the message, which is, add, ignore file

453
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.970
Marcus M Darden: It's a repo.

454
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.169
Marcus M Darden: And then when I write and quit this, it saves it and makes the commit.

455
01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:22.640
Marcus M Darden: Remember we said you could do something like git config dash dash local. I'm gonna do it local, because I don't want it everywhere.

456
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.909
Marcus M Darden: what do we say? Core.editor is code dash dash wait.

457
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:36.980
Marcus M Darden: So that was one of the ones from a previous slide, so that if you're wondering where that came from. So now, when I do this, let me,

458
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.980
Marcus M Darden: Echo more output.

459
01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.459
Marcus M Darden: And stick that on the back of output.

460
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.320
Marcus M Darden: Now, if I say git, add, output.

461
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.590
Marcus M Darden: Oh.

462
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:24.479
Marcus M Darden: it's in gitignore. So, gitignore is like, no, I won't do that for you. I will not do that for you. So I was trying to get it to add output, and it won't, because I said ignore it. I was like, why is that not working? So it's, ignored. So, so let's say, I want to add something else. So, we said something like echo…

463
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.680
Marcus M Darden: Pie, cash.

464
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:36.349
Marcus M Darden: I'm gonna dump that on the end of my gitignore. All right? Git status says, hey, look, gitignore has been changed, so if I do a git add commit.

465
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.210
Marcus M Darden: Now, it kicks me open.

466
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:58.149
Marcus M Darden: a Visual Studio Code window to make this edit, because I said that's what we're doing. So, this is where I can edit my commit message. I'm gonna say something like, ignore Python…

467
01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:00.060
Marcus M Darden: cache files.

468
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:07.830
Marcus M Darden: very descriptive, what I'm trying to do, it's… In that imperative mode.

469
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.040
Marcus M Darden: do this.

470
01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.920
Marcus M Darden: Alright, so if I then, save and exit.

471
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.870
Marcus M Darden: You'll see that mic.

472
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.309
Marcus M Darden: Commit has been done.

473
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.049
Marcus M Darden: So now, if I do a git status.

474
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:33.139
Marcus M Darden: nothing to commit, I'm gonna ignore some things. So, it's set in the, where did it go?

475
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:47.699
Marcus M Darden: It said in here, add something like pycache, anything.py, I, pynb checkpoints, And… there we go.

476
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.410
Marcus M Darden: add… There we go.

477
01:04:51.520 --> 01:05:05.959
Marcus M Darden: And it says here at the bottom, tip, add data files to Gitignore. Same sort of thing, you don't usually want to commit your data, you don't want to commit your outputs. You're trying to commit your work product, which is your source code, and any messages and notes about that source code, but not the input or output that it uses.

478
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.050
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

479
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.330
Marcus M Darden: I talked about adding a gitignore, we did that.

480
01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:26.100
Marcus M Darden: And so, now we're at remotes. So this is what I asked you to do originally when I said clone the student repo, the W26 repo. You'd do something like this. This creates a subdirectory, wherever you are.

481
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.800
Marcus M Darden: So you would want to go into the courses.

482
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:38.029
Marcus M Darden: I think Rafe just released the, the project, so go to your course's EX291 directory, and then say git clone

483
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.619
Marcus M Darden: the project one. I think I can do that?

484
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:55.790
Marcus M Darden: I'm the right… There we go.

485
01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:02.840
Marcus M Darden: Okay, so I'm gonna come up a level, and I'm in my EX291 directory, and I say git clone HTTPS

486
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:14.480
Marcus M Darden: And… github.com, x291staff, And I think it's called P1…

487
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.010
Marcus M Darden: Oh…

488
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.580
Marcus M Darden: I don't believe that works.

489
01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:53.759
Marcus M Darden: I don't know, follow directions on Rape's post about how to get it down. That's typically how it works, I don't know why it's asking me for a username there. Normally, when you clone from HTTPS, it just lets you do so without

490
01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:21.980
Marcus M Darden: Oh, I'm in the wrong place. He gives you another one. This is my directory on the whole thing.

491
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.039
Marcus M Darden: Okay, don't worry about it. He's got… he's got other information about what you should be doing, so…

492
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.149
Marcus M Darden: But if I wanted to clone this repo, I should be able to do this here, as I own it. I don't know why.

493
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.599
Marcus M Darden: Okay. So,

494
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:47.950
Marcus M Darden: Once you clone, remember we have these two commands, git pull and git push, which I said sound really opposite each other, they are not.

495
01:07:47.980 --> 01:08:04.689
Marcus M Darden: Because git pull is actually a combination of git fetch, which is the dead opposite of git push. Git push goes from the local repo to the remote, git fetch goes from the remotes to the local repo. Git merge also sort of takes those changes that came from the,

496
01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.339
Marcus M Darden: Remote, and integrates them into your current working directory.

497
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.540
Marcus M Darden: So that will change things for you from afar.

498
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:21.549
Marcus M Darden: So that's all we do with remote. We won't do that, and unless we're doing a clone, pull, or push, everything that you're doing in Git is local. Everything is on your machine.

499
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:38.950
Marcus M Darden: How do we get help? We've got git help, git help, and then whatever command you want to use. You can also use git command with dash dash help. It should break into a help update there, so I want to know how to do something like, for instance, get help rebase.

500
01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:48.810
Marcus M Darden: tells me all about how to do rebasing, and that's a future topic, but you can see I've got all of the things. It says you can use slash to search.

501
01:08:49.569 --> 01:08:52.910
Marcus M Darden: inside of this, and you can also use Q to get out.

502
01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.750
Marcus M Darden: I say, get rebase dash dash help, You get the same thing?

503
01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.349
Marcus M Darden: You can go with git rebase-H.

504
01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:05.960
Marcus M Darden: I get a shorter version of it.

505
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.289
Marcus M Darden: So this one just says, okay, I'm just gonna show you all the flags, none of the discussion.

506
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:17.410
Marcus M Darden: So there's a few different ways that you can scrub up some help.

507
01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:22.419
Marcus M Darden: Alright, try this.

508
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.310
Marcus M Darden: Git to a clean directory that is not inside of a Git repo.

509
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.590
Marcus M Darden: CD to that location.

510
01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:44.510
Marcus M Darden: and create a repo, right? You get to a place that's not inside there, then you create a new fi- a new folder with make dir.

511
01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:50.140
Marcus M Darden: Create a repo, remember we said we're going to use git init?

512
01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.549
Marcus M Darden: To create an empty repo.

513
01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:07.360
Marcus M Darden: Edit a file, you saw how I did it, you can also do it with code, sorry, VS Code, or you can do it with any other editor you want. Edit the file, do a commit, edit, stage, commit, edit, stage, commit.

514
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:13.490
Marcus M Darden: So, add a file and commit it, then edit it, stage it, and commit it.

515
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.160
Marcus M Darden: I managed to check out history.

516
01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:31.249
Marcus M Darden: Deeds suck, just let me know.

517
01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.070
Marcus M Darden: I realized I hadn't had a mic on, so…

518
01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.210
Marcus M Darden: Might have a rough transcript from today.

519
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.969
Marcus M Darden: Microphone now. Check, check.

520
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:41.620
Marcus M Darden: Alright, getting low on minutes here. I did all of those steps.

521
01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:49.139
Marcus M Darden: You can see it up there, I started with making some directory called exercise, I changed into the directory, then I did a git init.

522
01:17:49.340 --> 01:18:07.790
Marcus M Darden: Then I edited the file, which I did with Echo, but you could do that with any text editor. Then I did git add of that file, and you see me use these shortcuts up there, too, if that's a little confusing to you. You see that exclamation point dollar sign? That just means use the very last term from the line above.

523
01:18:08.130 --> 01:18:11.980
Marcus M Darden: So when I said, make Dur Exercise CD Bank dollar.

524
01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:36.749
Marcus M Darden: That's the same as saying, make dir exercise CD exercise. And so you see, I typed CD bang dollar and hit enter, and then it was like, oh, you meant CD exercise, right? Yes, I did. And then when I said git init, and I said echo exercise into readme, and then I said git add bang dollar, which is the same thing as saying git add readme, which is what it told me there. And I said, yep, that's what I meant. I don't have to confirm it, it's just telling me

525
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:37.580
Marcus M Darden: what's happening.

526
01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:55.989
Marcus M Darden: So after I did that, it said, create a repo, add a file, commit it, which I did there, and then it said, edit the file, stage it, and commit it again, which I did in those next three steps, and then it says check the history, which I was able to do by saying git log.

527
01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:13.539
Marcus M Darden: So, I just copied all of that output into a text file. I'll dump that into the repo so that you can pull it down later for remembering things, adding notes. You should be able to do this, like, with your eyes closed, right? I should be able to create a new repo pretty easily, go into the directory, call git init.

528
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:22.639
Marcus M Darden: maybe edit and add the README so I know what I'm even doing here. Later on, then you can open up that directory in VS Code and start adding things to it.

529
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:38.750
Marcus M Darden: Or whatnot. If you have a directory that already has files in it that isn't a git repo, you still use git init. You just jump in there, and all of the files that are there will show up as untracked. You jump in the directory, say git init, now I have a repo, add everything in here, and then commit it.

530
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:41.739
Marcus M Darden: So, that's another thing that you can do.

531
01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:50.500
Marcus M Darden: My 40-minute half lecture on Git has effectively eaten up all 80 of our minutes.

532
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:57.330
Marcus M Darden: So, here we are at our workflow loop. Edit, stage, commit.

533
01:19:57.510 --> 01:20:00.979
Marcus M Darden: And then when we're starting to use something remote, that's when we do a push.

534
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:16.950
Marcus M Darden: But for now, we just edit, stage, commit, edit, stage, commit, edit, stage, commit, we're good. And that really is edit, get add, get commit. Edit, get add, get commit. Next topics, we'll talk about more about remotes, branching and merging, and we'll have to do some conflict resolution when you try to merge things.

535
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:28.019
Marcus M Darden: Git is really good at making things merge that were two different things, but it's not perfect. And so, when you try to merge two things that Git can't figure out how to do, it gives you what's known as a conflict and says.

536
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:47.689
Marcus M Darden: here, I don't know whether I should choose this text or that text, and you have to go in as the human and decide what to do. So this can happen when two people are editing the same file for different tasks on the same project. You might want to incorporate your changes without breaking theirs. And if it can't figure out how to do that, it will make you do it. That's what conflict resolution is.

537
01:20:47.690 --> 01:20:54.730
Marcus M Darden: Time travel, we already looked at some of that. We looked at visiting the past, we haven't changed any of it yet, so we can do that later.

538
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:56.160
Marcus M Darden: Alright.

539
01:20:56.510 --> 01:21:00.449
Marcus M Darden: So, some resources here. Learn Git Branching.

540
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:14.919
Marcus M Darden: And also the W3 Schools tutorial. Both of these are great places to learn more about Git. Learn Git branching is gonna get you into branches, so it's a great place to go once you figure… once you've got your base Git figured out.

541
01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.960
Marcus M Darden: All right, last slide. Wrapped up.

542
01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.490
Marcus M Darden: And… we're outta here.
